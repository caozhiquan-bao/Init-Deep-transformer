what do you do when you have this sort of dis@@ rup@@ ted flow ?
ste@@ phen pal@@ um@@ bi : following the mer@@ cur@@ y tra@@ il
i really thought they were so bene@@ ath me .
but we didn &apos;t realize at the time that we actually needed a third mani@@ pul@@ ator , because we couldn &apos;t manipu@@ late the ne@@ ck from inside and walk the horse at the same time .
so here are some hal@@ f-@@ finished hor@@ ses ready to be worked in london .
the way a ho@@ of comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it &apos;s a convin@@ cing horse action .
ak : mi@@ key bre@@ tt from lei@@ ce@@ ster@@ shi@@ re .
so the culture , the northern ab@@ original culture , tradition@@ ally has been highly seas@@ onal .
but by the end of the 20th century , a new generation of cri@@ tics and re@@ form@@ ers had come to see phil@@ anthrop@@ y just this way .
wis@@ er sets out to docum@@ ent , link and em@@ power what paul calls the largest movement , and fa@@ ste@@ st-@@ growing movement in human history : humanity &apos;s collective imm@@ une response to today &apos;s thre@@ ats .
and imagine the ma@@ sh@@ -up , if you will , of these things , in the future , when these things come together in the experiments of the future -- imagine that somebody puts up , say , 100 million dollars for an in@@ spir@@ ing goal -- there were 21 gif@@ ts of 100 million dollars or more in the us last year , not out of the question -- but only puts it up if it &apos;s mat@@ ched by millions of small gif@@ ts from around the glo@@ be , there@@ by eng@@ aging lots of people , and building visi@@ bility and eng@@ aging people in the goal that &apos;s st@@ ated .
many of you will realize that i &apos;m ri@@ pping a bit off of the science fi@@ ction writer ver@@ nor vin@@ ge &apos;s notion of a technologi@@ cal sing@@ ul@@ ar@@ ity , where a number of trends acceler@@ ate and conver@@ ge and come together to create , really , a sho@@ ck@@ ingly new reality .
in this u@@ pli@@ f@@ ting talk , ka@@ ther@@ ine ful@@ ton sk@@ et@@ ches the new future of phil@@ anthrop@@ y -- one where collaboration and innovation allow regular people to do big things , even when money is sc@@ ar@@ ce . giving five practical examples of crow@@ d-@@ driven phil@@ anthrop@@ y , she calls for a new generation of citi@@ zen leaders .
there are three stories that i think are quite good examples .
but what is really ex@@ cep@@ tional is the setting .
they were living on top of the land they were labor@@ ing .
we worry that im , tex@@ ting , facebook are spo@@ iling human inti@@ ma@@ cy , but ste@@ fan@@ a broad@@ b@@ ent &apos;s research shows how communication tech is capable of cul@@ tiv@@ ating deeper relationships , bringing love across barri@@ ers like distance and work@@ place rules .
in the past , i &apos;ve been a race car ow@@ ner , a cre@@ w ch@@ ie@@ f and a driving co@@ ach , although maybe not at the level that you &apos;re currently expe@@ cting .
she &apos;s putting electro@@ des on his head so that we can monit@@ or the electrical activity in john &apos;s brain as he ra@@ ces around the track .
so watch as john does this here .
autonom@@ ous cars are coming -- and they &apos;re going to drive better than you . chris ger@@ des reve@@ als how he and his team are developing robo@@ tic race cars that can drive at 150 mp@@ h while avo@@ i@@ ding every possible accident . and yet , in studying the bra@@ in@@ waves of professional ra@@ cing dri@@ vers , ger@@ des says he has ga@@ ined a new appreci@@ ation for the instin@@ cts of professional dri@@ vers . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
how you get it shouldn &apos;t make that much of a difference .
not quite an obvious alli@@ ance .
they &apos;re not the largest number of people , but they are some of the most expensive -- and in terms of the li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood for dom@@ esti@@ c ab@@ use , drug and al@@ co@@ hol ab@@ use , poor performance by their kids in schools and also poor health as a result of stress .
and how we manage our built environment affec@@ ts the health and well-@@ being of people every single day .
and it &apos;s about leading in a world that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear .
and by the time i &apos;d moved on , i was actually co@@ vering a third of my agen@@ cy &apos;s budget de@@ fic@@ it with speaking fe@@ es .
and last year , the president of the united states came out in fa@@ vor of gay marriage .
and then i went out into the dea@@ f world .
you can argue that it &apos;s harder in the united states -- our current pres@@ iden@@ cy not@@ with@@ standing -- to be a person of color .
and he worked very hard because there was nothing else to do .
in the time since that atlan@@ tic mon@@ th@@ ly story ran , the life expec@@ tan@@ cy for people with down syndro@@ me has tri@@ pl@@ ed .
we have to think about how we feel about cur@@ es al@@ together .
if some gl@@ ori@@ ous ange@@ l suddenly des@@ cen@@ ded through my living room cei@@ ling and off@@ ered to take away the children i have and give me other , better children -- more poli@@ te , fun@@ ni@@ er , ni@@ cer , smar@@ ter -- i would cl@@ ing to the children i have and pra@@ y away that at@@ ro@@ cious spec@@ tac@@ le .
in so far as he was exten@@ ding them , he was doing so as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ cally , which she thought could mean that there was a tumor of some kind in action .
most people don &apos;t know that when i went to high school in this country -- i applied for university at a time when i was convinced i was going to be an artist and be a sculp@@ tor .
and i said , &quot; boy , let &apos;s really do something that takes advantage of all these fe@@ atures , &quot; and thought that if we could address education , by le@@ ver@@ aging the children , and bringing to the world the access of the computers , that that was really the thing we should do .
this is being launched with three languages in it : squ@@ e@@ ak , lo@@ go , and a third , that i &apos;ve never even seen before .
in spi@@ te of what some people in the press don &apos;t get it , didn &apos;t understand it , we didn &apos;t take it off because we didn &apos;t want to do -- having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want .
it &apos;s a lot of stuff that goes behind these . these can talk to each other .
this was a period in my life where i was travel@@ ing 3@@ 30 days per year .
i want you do something else .
i , like many of you , am one of the two billion people on earth who live in cities .
and then we invited people all over the world to build them and experiment with us .
and what we &apos;re seeing is that r &amp; amp ; d-@@ i@@ -@@ y has moved beyond just window far@@ ms and le@@ ds into solar pan@@ els and a@@ qu@@ apo@@ ni@@ c systems .
and at that moment our economy collap@@ ses .
that machine doesn &apos;t care about the environment , about ra@@ c@@ ism , about all these issues that make this life worse for all of us , and so the government does have a role to take resources from more productive uses , or from ri@@ cher sources , and give them to other sources .
the vast majority want to protect military defen@@ se spending .
the vast majority of econom@@ ists -- it is so un@@ cool to call yourself an ide@@ olo@@ gue of either camp .
and that gets me back to the dollar , and it gets me back to re@@ min@@ ding myself that we know this experience .
and as he did so , his custom@@ er noticed that on the back side of the balance whe@@ el was an en@@ gra@@ ving , were words .
&quot; why ? &quot; and they &apos;d say , &quot; oh , it feels so natural , &quot; or , &quot; it &apos;s nice . &quot;
these are the bits , the pleasure centers , and maybe what i &apos;m seeing and sen@@ sing and feeling is by@@ pas@@ sing my thinking .
stop . stop . how do you feel ?
pa@@ tho@@ s appe@@ ars obviously as part of what you just saw in that little girl &apos;s drawing .
an@@ a@@ is n@@ in and the tal@@ mu@@ d have told us time and time again that we see things not as they are , but as we are .
so it disappe@@ ars .
another milli@@ meter ?
now i &apos;m using micro@@ seconds wr@@ on@@ g@@ ly here , so please ignor@@ e me .
look at that . do you want to see it again ?
these people , many of whom have lived in north oxford , have argu@@ ed -- they &apos;ve argu@@ ed that belie@@ ving in god is ak@@ in to belie@@ ving in fa@@ i@@ ries and essentially that the whole thing is a chil@@ dis@@ h game .
the se@@ cular world is full of holes .
what we need is information .
religi@@ ons go , &quot; non@@ sense .
religious view says we need cal@@ en@@ dar@@ s , we need to structure time , we need to syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ ze en@@ counter@@ s .
the other thing that religi@@ ons know is we &apos;re not just brains , we are also bodies .
but if we &apos;re serious people , we don &apos;t ad@@ mit to that .
let &apos;s think of something else .
we need to group together .
absolutely . i , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; but isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
you move on .
and that feeling also led me to a pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge of sorts , to go literally to the ends of the earth to see telescop@@ es , dete@@ c@@ tors , instruments that people are building , or have built , in order to probe the co@@ smo@@ s in greater and greater detail .
but you need very , very large vol@@ um@@ es of water in order to do this .
they work on a sho@@ e@@ string budget .
and that &apos;s where they do their experiments , and then the ballo@@ on , the pay@@ load , is brought down .
and this particular ballo@@ on , because it has to laun@@ ch two tons of weight , is an extremely huge ballo@@ on .
thank you .
so if we start with books , you know , sort of where are we ?
we actually went off to make a boo@@ k@@ mobile .
one is a prin@@ t-@@ on-@@ demand machine that looks like a ru@@ be gold@@ berg machine .
the chinese did over a million , and the eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ ans are about 3@@ 0,000 .
we &apos;ve now got eight of these scan@@ ning centers in three countries , and libr@@ aries are up for having their books scan@@ ned .
so how much is there ?
we &apos;re not quite a youtube .
if you go and search on something -- this is goog@@ le@@ .com , the different ver@@ sions of it that we have , this is what it looks like when it was an al@@ ph@@ a rele@@ ase , and this is what it looked like at stanford .
it &apos;s not too big -- about the size of a golf ball .
this gift came to me about five months ago .
most of you are familiar with por@@ to@@ b@@ ell@@ o mus@@ h@@ rooms .
it in@@ hal@@ es oxygen , just like we do .
ox@@ ali@@ c ac@@ id is two carbon dio@@ xi@@ de molecules jo@@ ined together .
how is it that this organis@@ m can be so large , and yet be one cell wall th@@ ick , whereas we have five or six skin la@@ yers that protect us ?
so , we set up a site in ma@@ son coun@@ ty , washington , and we &apos;ve seen a dra@@ matic de@@ cre@@ ase in the amount of co@@ li@@ forms .
our mus@@ h@@ room stra@@ ins were in the highly active range .
now after spo@@ ru@@ lation , the spor@@ es re@@ pel .
now , three cor@@ n@@ co@@ bs , no other gra@@ in -- lots of mus@@ h@@ rooms begin to form .
over the top it was se@@ aled with steel and glass , underneath it was se@@ aled with a pan of steel -- essentially entirely se@@ aled .
will it work ? or will something happen that we can &apos;t understand and we can &apos;t fix , there@@ by ne@@ g@@ ating the concept of man@@ -@@ made bio@@ sp@@ her@@ es ?
we were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere .
not me , that was for sure .
not only that , but i lost touch of where my food came from .
and the man@@ gro@@ ves were provi@@ ding wood and hon@@ ey and leaves for the animals , so that they could produce milk and what@@ not , like we had in the bio@@ sphere .
they go , &quot; but how can i possibly find my way in that ?
but we can look at the world , and try to understand where we are in its context , and how we choose to interact with it .
and the answer is yes and no ; it &apos;s deeper than all of that .
go a couple generations forward to where we are , though , and it looks like a completely different world .
our experience as people who get sick , need help from other people , is that we have amazing clin@@ i@@ cians that we can turn to -- hard@@ working , incredibly well-@@ trained and very smart -- that we have access to incredible technologies that give us great hope , but little sense that it consi@@ st@@ ently all comes together for you from start to finish in a successful way .
now a system , however , when things start to come together , you realize it has certain skills for acting and looking that way .
and yet , what we found were that these were tools to help make experts better .
this is not yet our nor@@ m in surgery -- let alone making che@@ ck@@ li@@ sts to go onto child@@ birth and other areas .
now , that &apos;s a lot , a lot of bees , and that &apos;s really important .
and in fact , america was the first country that ever did ma@@ il@@ -@@ deli@@ very que@@ ens and in fact , it &apos;s part of the post@@ al code that you have to deliver que@@ ens by mail in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country .
and one of our real wor@@ ries with col@@ ony collap@@ se dis@@ order is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those de@@ ad@@ -@@ out col@@ on@@ ies .
so in an apple or@@ ch@@ ard , for instance , you &apos;ll have ro@@ ws of 10 ap@@ ples of one variety , and then you have another apple tree that &apos;s a different type of pollen .
and so it &apos;s not just hon@@ e@@ y@@ bees that are in trouble , but we don &apos;t understand these na@@ tive pol@@ lin@@ ators or all those other parts of our community .
i think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping law@@ ns at a limited scale , and i think we &apos;re encoura@@ ged to do that .
what is a ch@@ u@@ bby , cur@@ l@@ y-@@ ha@@ i@@ red guy from h@@ oll@@ and -- why is he whi@@ st@@ ling ?
but the du@@ tch people here will understand what i mean .
no , no , no . it &apos;s four minutes long .
and the artist that dre@@ w this obser@@ vation test did some er@@ r@@ ors , had some mista@@ kes -- there are more or less 12 mista@@ kes .
just to give you an example , every single ro@@ ot a@@ pe@@ x is able to dete@@ ct and to monit@@ or con@@ currently and continu@@ ously at least 15 different chemical and physical par@@ am@@ e@@ ters .
some of them are much more sophisticated .
now , there is a big problem behind all this behavior that we have seen .
they are a network of small computing machines , working in networks .
and before i finish , i would like to reas@@ sure that no sna@@ ils were har@@ med in making this pres@@ entation .
now in the mean@@ time , i have six friends who are waiting at the next six con@@ se@@ cu@@ tive st@@ ops in their under@@ wear as well .
this janu@@ ary , we did the 10@@ th an@@ nu@@ al no pants sub@@ way ride where a diver@@ se group of 3@@ ,@@ 500 people ro@@ de the train in their under@@ wear in new york -- almost every single train line in the city .
and i was standing just anony@@ m@@ ously in a swe@@ at@@ shir@@ t , putting my hand on and off of a tr@@ as@@ h@@ can to signal the advan@@ c@@ ement .
you can see them in this foot@@ age .
so there &apos;s a photograph that illu@@ str@@ ates it a little bit better .
there was no way to predict how far it would spread through water supp@@ lies and how bad the situation would get .
i think it &apos;s time for us to apply them to water .
and then , more recently , they really began to do sort of rever@@ se engineering on this be@@ ast and figure out just what the parts were , how they worked and how they might be optimi@@ zed -- how they might be made better .
i &apos;m going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it -- education in world religi@@ ons , on world religi@@ ons , for all of our children in primary school , in high school , in public schools , in private schools and in home scho@@ ol@@ ing .
i don &apos;t think so .
&quot; how clever of she@@ ep ! &quot; you might say .
they &apos;re not really bright . they don &apos;t have to be .
and we &apos;re the ones that hold the paint@@ br@@ ush .
but i &apos;m not just talking about islam .
is the goal achie@@ ved ?
because i &apos;m absolutely sin@@ c@@ ere in my appreci@@ ation of all that i &apos;ve said about this book .
well , that &apos;s michael dent@@ on . he &apos;s a crea@@ tion@@ ist .
whose truth are we going to listen to ?
and here &apos;s one that shows the sort of current break@@ down of the different religi@@ ons .
the lou@@ dest sound you can hear is a trilli@@ on times more powerful than that .
these days , you can do a similar thing , it just looks a bit cool@@ er .
if you &apos;re going to use head@@ phones , buy the best ones you can afford because quality means you don &apos;t have to have it so l@@ oud .
and four mod@@ ali@@ ties where you need to take some action and get involved .
it sounds sil@@ ly , but i thought , okay , the way the world works can be changed , and it can be changed by me in these small ways .
we know how it &apos;s supposed to work , so we can &apos;t suppose all the things that could be possible .
and the electricity runs through your body too .
and now if i ho@@ ok up this wire just by conne@@ cting it to the left ar@@ row , i &apos;m kind of progra@@ mming it by where i ho@@ ok it up , now i have a left ar@@ row and a right ar@@ row , so i should be able to go for@@ wards and back@@ wards and for@@ wards and back@@ wards . a@@ wes@@ ome .
we &apos;re like , &quot; we &apos;re spon@@ sor@@ ing you , man .
but as i &apos;m kind of getting older and kind of mess@@ ing with all this stuff , i &apos;m reali@@ zing that my idea of a perfect world really can &apos;t be designed by one person or even by a million experts .
they chur@@ n up de@@ br@@ is in their surro@@ und@@ ings .
and he took schwar@@ z@@ schil@@ d &apos;s idea to the pr@@ us@@ si@@ an acade@@ my of sci@@ ences the next week .
and if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light len@@ sed around it , and we could even start to cross into that sha@@ dow and really not notice that anything dra@@ matic had happened .
but i &apos;d like to play for you the sound that we predict .
lu@@ ck@@ ily we &apos;re at this safe distance in long beach , california .
four@@ te@@ en billion years pass and this song is still r@@ inging all around us .
or , is it possible that we &apos;re just a bran@@ ch off of a multi@@ verse -- each bran@@ ch with its own big bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing dru@@ ms , maybe some without -- maybe some with sen@@ ti@@ ent life , and maybe some without -- not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundament@@ ally connected to us ?
the united states has over 2.@@ 3 million in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated men and women .
the story i wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an ir@@ ani@@ an artist , as an ir@@ ani@@ an woman artist , as an ir@@ ani@@ an woman artist living in exi@@ le .
for the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics .
i work in mor@@ oc@@ co , in tur@@ key , in mexico .
these are some of the images and the characters of the film .
it needs the help of mother , or a fo@@ ster mother , to survive .
what they have swe@@ ated so far has no meaning .
it &apos;s not an action , but in the english language , it is also an action .
everything is going to be limit@@ less .
that &apos;s interesting to me .
and for dollars , is their 30 million , plus the 20 million dollars from the american manufac@@ tur@@ er .
and someone wrote just on youtube -- it was a youtube com@@ ment : &quot; first time i s@@ mil@@ ed doing a der@@ i@@ va@@ tive . &quot;
the other thing that happened -- and even at this point , i said , &quot; okay , maybe it &apos;s a good supp@@ le@@ ment .
but it &apos;s fundament@@ ally different than what &apos;s happening in class@@ rooms right now .
we have about 90 of these right now .
blue means they &apos;re working on it -- no need to worry .
but when you let every student work at their own p@@ ace -- and we see it over and over and over again -- you see students who took a little bit &#91; of &#93; extra time on one concept or the other , but once they get through that concept , they just race ahead .
and i have to make it clear , it &apos;s not just me anymore .
we made some of those for students so they could see their data , but we have a very ti@@ ght design loo@@ p with the teachers themselves .
and we are familiar with the landscap@@ es of our own imagination , our in@@ scap@@ es . we &apos;ve lived with them all our lives .
then it changes again .
and i then said to her , &quot; i think i know what you have . &quot;
and in 17@@ 5@@ 9 , he described to his grand@@ son various things he was seeing .
on one occasi@@ on , she said she saw a man in a stri@@ ped shir@@ t in a restaurant .
something like 10 percent , as i said , of visu@@ ally im@@ pa@@ i@@ red people get these .
and in fact , to find that different parts of the visual brain are activ@@ ated as they are hallu@@ cin@@ ating .
normally these are all part of the integr@@ ated stream of perception , or imagination , and one is not conscious of them .
well , yeah , a lot of them .
since my my first di@@ ve in a deep@@ -@@ di@@ ving sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , when i went down and turned out the lights and saw the fire@@ works dis@@ plays , i &apos;ve been a bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ c@@ ence jun@@ ky .
but it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
and you see things like this .
it &apos;s just 16 blue le@@ ds that we can program to do different types of dis@@ plays .
but if it had been following the od@@ or plu@@ me , it would have come in from the other direction .
thank you .
in the top le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand corner , you &apos;ve got this yel@@ low-@@ green area .
now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you , cop@@ ying your dna with ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te fi@@ deli@@ ty .
when the cell feels it &apos;s ready to go , it ri@@ ps apart the chromo@@ some .
it &apos;s also an attention sen@@ sing system .
the world needs you , b@@ ad@@ ly .
a metaphor will serve here : where eli@@ te mathemati@@ cians and statisti@@ cians and the@@ ori@@ sts often serve as architec@@ ts in the exp@@ anding real@@ m of science , the rema@@ ining large majority of basic applied scientists , including a large por@@ tion of those who could be said to be of the first r@@ ank , are the ones who map the ter@@ rain , they sc@@ out the fron@@ ti@@ ers , they cut the path@@ ways , some may have considered me fo@@ ol@@ har@@ dy , but it &apos;s been my hab@@ it to br@@ ush asi@@ de the fear of mathematics when talking to can@@ di@@ date scientists .
in sel@@ ec@@ ting a subject in which to condu@@ ct original research , or to develop worl@@ d-@@ class exper@@ ti@@ se , take a part of the cho@@ sen discipl@@ ine that is spar@@ sely in@@ hab@@ ited .
the problem may be relatively small ; for example , where exactly in a cru@@ ise ship does the nor@@ o@@ virus begin to spread ?
in fact , if you look back , human communication media and the ways in which we organi@@ ze so@@ cially have been co-@@ evol@@ ving for quite a long time .
evolution is spee@@ ding up .
gar@@ re@@ tt hard@@ in used it to talk about over@@ population in the late 196@@ 0s .
el@@ i li@@ l@@ ly -- in , again , the fi@@ er@@ c@@ ely competi@@ tive pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical world -- has created a market for solutions for pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical problems .
when the scientific method provi@@ ded that new way of thinking and biology showed that micro@@ organisms caused disease , suffering was alle@@ vi@@ ated .
and so , when you fly down -- thank you . when you fly down to the ground , and you see this kind of pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ gery , the first thing that you might notice is that it &apos;s not just a picture , there &apos;s just as much three-@@ dimensional understanding of this environment as there is of the three-@@ dimensional city from above , so if i click on something to get a closer view of it , then , the fact that that transition looks as it does , is a function of all of that geome@@ try , all of that 3d understanding behind this model .
no , no . the other way .
thank you all very much .
he was working in a big bank .
and this other condition we called the s@@ is@@ yp@@ hi@@ c condition .
in this other version of the experiment , we didn &apos;t put people in this situation , we just described to them the situation , much as i am descri@@ bing to you now , and we asked them to predict what the result would be .
and everybody raised their hand .
the experim@@ enter looked at it , took the she@@ et of paper , did not look at it , did not scan it , and simply put it on the pi@@ le of pages .
so this is all in terms of negative motivation or elimin@@ ating negative motivation .
now you had to break the eg@@ gs and add them .
for some people we made it harder by hi@@ ding the in@@ struc@@ tions .
those are really tough .
this is a picture of my family , my four si@@ bl@@ ings -- my mom and i -- taken in 197@@ 7 .
my family was moved from ph@@ no@@ m pen@@ h to pur@@ sat pro@@ vin@@ ce .
a pretty i@@ dy@@ lli@@ c place on the me@@ kon@@ g del@@ ta .
yet , there is hope .
&quot; because you have felt me , i can feel myself again . &quot;
the european union d@@ ele@@ gation in kab@@ u@@ l came into this and hi@@ red me to work inside the mini@@ stry of public health , to lo@@ bby this approach -- we succe@@ e@@ ded .
i thank you for your attention .
let &apos;s say the produ@@ c@@ tivity of bio@@ fuel plan@@ tations is 1,@@ 200 li@@ tr@@ es of bio@@ fuel per he@@ ct@@ are per year .
countries are different from each other .
what this means is , even if you covered the whole of the united king@@ dom with energy cro@@ ps , you couldn &apos;t match today &apos;s energy consumption .
of course , other me@@ tri@@ cs matter too , and nuclear power has all sorts of popul@@ ar@@ ity problems .
in between , perhaps some more reali@@ stic op@@ tions on this le@@ ver , transport le@@ ver , are electric vehi@@ cles , so electric bi@@ kes and electric cars in the middle , perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard pe@@ tro@@ l-@@ powered t@@ ank .
so i &apos;m a strong ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ate of having grow@@ n-@@ up conver@@ sa@@ tions that are based on numbers and facts , and i want to close with this map that just visu@@ ali@@ zes for you the requi@@ re@@ ment of land and so forth in order to get just 16 light bul@@ bs per person from four of the big possible sources .
two months ago , i remem@@ ber@@ ed that promise i made , when a dist@@ ingu@@ ished english cri@@ tic published an article in the london times , asking who could be the w@@ inner of the orche@@ str@@ a world c@@ up .
he was the conduc@@ tor of the go@@ th@@ en@@ bur@@ g sym@@ ph@@ ony orche@@ str@@ a , and he &apos;s an unbe@@ at@@ able example for young musi@@ cians in la@@ tin america and the world .
the huge spi@@ ritual world that music produ@@ ces in itself , which also lies within itself , ends up over@@ coming material poverty .
because that moment when you answer the phone is a cognitive test every time that you do it .
how do you put simple dis@@ rup@@ tive technologies , and the first of five phr@@ ases that i &apos;m going to talk about in this talk ?
i mean you probably saw these head@@ lines . this is ca@@ ther@@ ine cas@@ ey who is the first bo@@ om@@ er to actually get social security .
and just as 30 years ago we couldn &apos;t conc@@ ei@@ ve that we would have the power of a ma@@ infra@@ me computer that took up a room this size in our pur@@ ses and on our bel@@ ts , that we &apos;re carrying around in our cell phone today , and suddenly , computing , that used to be an exper@@ t driven system , it was a personal system that we all ow@@ ned as part of our daily lives -- that shift from ma@@ infra@@ me to personal computing is what we have to do for health@@ care .
raise your hand if you had a serious fall in your house@@ hold , or any of your loved ones , your parents or so forth . right ?
i &apos;m a qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative resear@@ cher , but when i look at these data stre@@ ams coming in from these homes , i can look at the data and tell you the day that some doctor pres@@ cri@@ bed them something that nobody else knew that they were on , because we see the changes in their patterns in the house@@ hold . right ?
the president needs to stand up and say , at the end of a health@@ care re@@ form debate , &quot; our goal as a country is to move 50 percent of care out of institutions , clin@@ ics , hospit@@ als and nur@@ sing homes , to the home , in 10 years . &quot;
today , we will see 2@@ 50,000 individual new computer viruses .
cyber@@ crimin@@ als now have crime pac@@ ks with business intelligence repor@@ ting das@@ h@@ bo@@ ards to manage the distribution of their mali@@ cious code .
mal@@ ware is very bor@@ ing otherwise .
we really should clean that up .
one of these was more ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical for me .
i was relatively in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited compared to the cyber@@ crimin@@ als , who wouldn &apos;t be so concerned by law , and here you can see my mobile device .
we also need to think very carefully about how we develop our future talent pool .
i was fortun@@ ate in finding things .
michael cri@@ cht@@ on really was one of the first people to talk about bringing dinosaurs back to life .
but she did find he@@ me , which is the biological foundation of he@@ mo@@ glo@@ bin .
and so here was the first soft tissue from a dinosau@@ r .
the si@@ x@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders look at it and they say , &quot; no . &quot;
and that &apos;s pretty cool .
and i said , &quot; well , if you can find those , i can just rever@@ se them and make what i need to make for the si@@ x@@ th-@@ gra@@ ders . &quot;
actually , i think it &apos;s a great way to teach kids about evolutionary biology and develop@@ mental biology and all sorts of things .
so i took the food supply of every single country and i compared it to what was actually likely to be being consum@@ ed in each country .
so i want you to imagine that these nine bis@@ cu@@ its that i found in the bin represent the global food supply , okay ? we start out with nine .
we contribu@@ te to that squ@@ ee@@ ze by de@@ pos@@ iting food in b@@ ins here in britain and el@@ se@@ where in the world . we take food off the market shel@@ ves that hun@@ gry people dep@@ end on .
most people . the one on the left was kept in a fri@@ dge for 10 days .
tri@@ stra@@ m stu@@ art : the global food waste sc@@ and@@ al
there we see mars , again with various names .
mon@@ keys , ch@@ im@@ ps , just get rid of the ha@@ ir@@ y creatures . &quot;
it &apos;s clear to me . &quot;
mar@@ ti@@ ans , ven@@ usi@@ ans , jo@@ vi@@ ans .
which is not to be conf@@ used with the five sac@@ red sal@@ ads .
so , maps of things leading to organized under@@ stand@@ ings of the universe in which we emer@@ ge .
ren@@ é des@@ car@@ tes , of course . once again these gren@@ ada people , this is like way too sick for anybody &apos;s imagination .
just a ti@@ p , if you &apos;re being photograph@@ ed for press pictures , don &apos;t touch your teeth .
symme@@ try , pa@@ irs .
which works mathema@@ tically , but it just doesn &apos;t seem go@@ d-@@ like to me .
thank you .
it was actually interesting that such a commun@@ ist principle was the basis of a system developed during the cold war by the defen@@ se department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the internet .
it didn &apos;t think of itself as being on the internet .
it &apos;s turning into one of these big emer@@ gent systems like the financial system , where we &apos;ve designed all the parts but nobody really exactly under@@ stands how it oper@@ ates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emer@@ gent behaviors it can have .
in the 197@@ 0s and 198@@ 0s , a gener@@ ous spirit suff@@ used the internet , whose users were few and far between . but today , the net is u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous , conne@@ cting billions of people , machines and essential pieces of infrastructure -- leaving us vulnerable to cyber@@ -@@ attack or mel@@ t@@ down . internet pi@@ one@@ er dan@@ ny hil@@ li@@ s argu@@ es that the internet wasn &apos;t designed for this kind of scale , and sounds a cl@@ ari@@ on call for us to develop a plan b : a parallel system to fall back on if -- or when -- the internet cr@@ as@@ hes .
however , if we &apos;d had this talk 60 years ago , we would have seen how the emergen@@ ce of new air@@ craft and t@@ ank technologies , which give the advantage to the attac@@ ker , make the bli@@ tz@@ krieg doc@@ tr@@ ine very cre@@ di@@ ble and th@@ us create the possibility of war in europe .
if you remember the cold war , it was a very hard game , but a stable one played only by two players , which allowed for some co@@ ordin@@ ation between the two super@@ power@@ s .
but i &apos;d like to rela@@ y to you a childhood experience of mine that really made me see the ocean differently , and it &apos;s become the foundation of my work because , i feel like , if in a day , i can see the ocean differently , then i can ev@@ o@@ ke that same kind of change in others , especially kids .
it &apos;s not a dinosau@@ r ; it &apos;s a wh@@ ale , animals as big as office buildings still swi@@ mming around out there in our ocean .
he sho@@ ots out these sti@@ cky we@@ bs to ent@@ angle his ene@@ my .
he uses his wonderful skills at navi@@ gation to wan@@ der the oceans , looking for a mate .
he wanted me to use words like poly@@ vin@@ y@@ l ch@@ l@@ ori@@ de , which doesn &apos;t really work in voice ballo@@ ons very well .
i do three or four stri@@ ps after that where we explore the fin@@ ning issue and the shar@@ k f@@ in sou@@ p issue .
and you find other things , and you break that up , and you hau@@ l those away .
he came back to california and named his dog after that river of en@@ chan@@ t@@ ment .
decisions that will be made this year will literally deter@@ mine the fa@@ te of this country .
audience : 4@@ 7 .
1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 9 . 1@@ 3@@ 6@@ 9 .
audience : oh , 7@@ 22 .
i &apos;ll talk to you later .
that &apos;s three . the od@@ ds of me getting all four of these right by random gu@@ ess@@ ing would be one in 10,000 : 10 to the fourth power .
195@@ 9 , ok -- and the month ?
yes . yeah , ok . i &apos;ll tell you what , chris : as long as you have that book in front of you , do me a fa@@ vor , turn to a year outside of the 19@@ 00@@ s , either into the 18@@ 00@@ s or way into the 200@@ 0s -- that &apos;ll be a much greater challenge for me .
audience : seven . seven .
i &apos;ll start the problem in the middle , with 5@@ 7 times 6@@ 8@@ 3 .
the second time , it &apos;s engineering .
what i ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomen@@ ally good at text mes@@ sa@@ ging and spend a huge amount of on-@@ screen time , but have never gone bow@@ ling together ?
instead , i &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
anyone who &apos;s a musi@@ cian has been pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly influ@@ enced by robert mo@@ o@@ g .
you won &apos;t need to know tri@@ g .
set it up to around a , above a , above a . there &apos;s an a , more or less .
i &apos;m studying physics : lan@@ da@@ u , li@@ p@@ sch@@ it@@ z , res@@ ni@@ ck and hal@@ li@@ day .
i clim@@ b up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you clim@@ b up this woo@@ den la@@ d@@ der .
lots of credit card de@@ bt , huge environmental foot@@ prin@@ ts , and perhaps not co@@ inci@@ dent@@ ally , our happiness levels fl@@ at@@ -@@ lin@@ ed over the same 50 years .
but we want stuff that we &apos;re going to love for years , not just stuff .
what &apos;s in y@@ ours ?
and something very unusual happens .
and she begins to bab@@ ble and co@@ o and s@@ mile , and so does the baby .
but it has to be safe explor@@ ation .
i walked into the car@@ ne@@ gie asking for a gr@@ ant .
now , the program says that the opposite of play is not work , it &apos;s depression .
kev@@ in car@@ roll came from extremely de@@ pri@@ ved circum@@ stances : al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic mother , ab@@ sent father , inner@@ -@@ city phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phi@@ a , black , had to take care of a yo@@ unger brother .
flow is the mental state of app@@ ari@@ tion in which the person is fully immer@@ sed in what he or she is doing .
and the fact that the pol@@ ar bear and hus@@ ky or mag@@ p@@ ie and a bear or you and i and our dogs can cros@@ so@@ ver and have that experience sets play asi@@ de as something separate .
b@@ r : but it &apos;s not all just edi@@ ble pictures .
there &apos;s a lot of research and a lot of failure , trial and er@@ ror -- i guess , more er@@ ror -- that goes into each and every dis@@ h , so we don &apos;t always get it right , and it takes a while for us to be able to explain that to people .
so we really had to think about new , creative ways to fla@@ vor , new ways to co@@ ok and to change tex@@ ture -- and that was the main issue with this challenge .
and the cycle continu@@ es ; as we all know , bri@@ t@@ ney has lo@@ om@@ ed pretty large l@@ ately .
and l@@ est you think that you all , as the di@@ ger@@ at@@ i , are more en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ed , i went to the apple iphone ap@@ p store the other day .
and i came across this fantastic research by wol@@ f@@ gang kö@@ hl@@ er , the so@@ -@@ called father of gest@@ alt psych@@ ology , from 19@@ 27 , who sub@@ mit@@ ted to an audience like y@@ ourselves the following two shapes .
okay . so ...
you know , you &apos;re going to have these kind of bl@@ ur@@ ry spo@@ ts like this that maybe only res@@ em@@ ble eyes in a very very abstra@@ ct way .
i &apos;m at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on ; we &apos;ve got a great robo@@ tics institute there .
so i have a couple of really important questions for you .
when they sam@@ ple from animals , they collect the blood on the filter paper and this allows us to identify y@@ et@@ -@@ un@@ known viruses from exactly the right animals -- the ones that are actually being hun@@ ted .
but in fact that &apos;s not the only question they &apos;re going to ask you about this .
when i arrived i didn &apos;t speak a word of french , and i still seemed to understand what it was he was saying .
what we &apos;ve found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals , including new viruses in the same group as hiv -- so , brand new retro@@ viruses .
four years ago , on the ted stage , i announ@@ ced a company i was working with at the time called o@@ de@@ o .
in fact , there are 4@@ 7 members of con@@ gress who currently have twitter accoun@@ ts .
it &apos;s happened more and more l@@ ately , whether it &apos;s raising money for hom@@ eless people or to dig w@@ ells in africa or for a family in crisis .
i grew up on a university cam@@ pus in eastern nigeria .
my father was a professor .
in this single story there was no possibility of afri@@ cans being similar to her in any way , no possibility of feelings more complex than p@@ ity , no possibility of a connection as human equ@@ als .
a few years ago , i vis@@ ited mexico from the u.@@ s .
i did not have a single story of america .
what if my ro@@ om@@ mate knew about my nigeri@@ an publi@@ sh@@ er , mu@@ k@@ ta bak@@ ar@@ ay , a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publi@@ sh@@ ing house ?
the american writer ali@@ ce wal@@ ker wrote this about her southern rela@@ tives who had moved to the north .
as they listen@@ ed to the experts &apos; voices , the independent decisi@@ on-@@ making parts of their brains swi@@ t@@ ched off .
but how can we do this ?
but we need to go even further .
or , we decide that we &apos;re going to prevent de@@ men@@ ti@@ a , and it will never happen to us because we &apos;re going to do everything right and it won &apos;t come and get us .
would they give me acade@@ mic journ@@ als so i could scri@@ b@@ ble in the mar@@ g@@ ins ?
thank you .
now if you separate between the two , you could actually answer the need for a conven@@ i@@ ent car by creating a network , by creating a network before the cars show up .
what we found out , when you move from molecules to electr@@ ons , something interesting happens .
why ? because batter@@ ies life cycle improve -- a bit of impro@@ vement on energy den@@ sity , which redu@@ ces the price .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m ready for ce@@ o &quot; and he said , &quot; oh no no no no no . you &apos;ve got to explain to me , what is more important than saving your country and saving the world , that you would go and do ? &quot;
it &apos;s called the other car .
you know what happens at that point ?
we don &apos;t have any in@@ cen@@ tive to go and resol@@ ve it across the u.@@ s .
that &apos;s one percent a year .
and the u.k. had 100 years of economic growth .
there is an effective evolution lo@@ bby co@@ ordin@@ ating the fight on be@@ half of science , and i try to do all i can to help them , but they get quite up@@ set when people like me d@@ are to mention that we happen to be athei@@ sts as well as evolution@@ ists .
any designer capable of designing something really complex has to be even more complex himself , and that &apos;s before we even start on the other things he &apos;s expected to do , like for@@ give s@@ ins , bl@@ ess marri@@ ages , listen to pra@@ yers -- fa@@ vor our side in a war -- -- dis@@ appro@@ ve of our sex lives and so on .
there &apos;s dou@@ glas ad@@ ams , magni@@ fi@@ cent picture from his book , &quot; last chance to see . &quot;
as has been said before , we are all athei@@ sts about most of the go@@ ds that humanity has ever believed in . some of us just go one god further .
but let me know show you some data that have been proper@@ ly published and analy@@ zed on one special group , nam@@ ely , top scientists .
so , what other words might be used to smo@@ oth the path , oil the whe@@ els , sugar the p@@ ill ? darwin himself pre@@ fer@@ red &quot; ag@@ no@@ stic &quot; -- and not only out of lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty to his friend hu@@ x@@ ley , who co@@ ined the term .
but we don &apos;t bo@@ ther to say so , and this is why my friend uses &quot; to@@ oth fair@@ y ag@@ no@@ stic &quot; as a lab@@ el for what most people would call athei@@ st .
the religious lo@@ bby in this country is massi@@ vely finan@@ ced by foun@@ da@@ tions -- to say nothing of all the ta@@ x benefits -- by foun@@ da@@ tions such as the temp@@ le@@ ton foundation and the discovery institute .
four and a half million users around the world , contribu@@ ting their le@@ f@@ to@@ ver computer cy@@ cles , whenever their computer isn &apos;t working , by running a screen sa@@ ver , and together sharing their resources to create a massive super@@ computer that nasa har@@ n@@ esses to analy@@ ze the data coming from radio telescop@@ es .
this is not only outside of businesses . when you think of what is the critical innovation of google , the critical innovation is ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing the one most important thing -- the decision about what &apos;s relevant -- to the community of the web as a whole , doing whatever they want to do : so , page r@@ ank .
if you leave a $ 50 check after dinner with friends , you don &apos;t increase the prob@@ ability of being invited back .
social rela@@ tions and exchange become signific@@ antly more important than they ever were as an economic phenomenon . in some con@@ tex@@ ts , it &apos;s even more efficient because of the quality of the information , the ability to find the best person , the lower trans@@ action costs . it &apos;s sustainable and growing fast .
al@@ am@@ ie@@ y@@ es@@ ei@@ gh@@ a was ar@@ ra@@ ig@@ ned in london .
afri@@ cans , after -- they &apos;re ti@@ red , we &apos;re ti@@ red of being the subject of everybody &apos;s char@@ ity and care .
the smar@@ test one , first to come in , was the m@@ t@@ n company of south africa .
so all the changes and re@@ forms we were able to make have shown up in results that are meas@@ ur@@ able in the economy .
a new wave of open@@ ness and democra@@ ti@@ zation in which , since 2000 , more than two-@@ thir@@ ds of african countries have had multi-@@ party democratic elec@@ tions .
mix@@ ing african materials , such as we have , with materials from el@@ se@@ where .
now , you might think of flu as just a really bad cold , but it can be a death sentence .
you took a pa@@ tho@@ gen , you modi@@ fied it , you inje@@ cted it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
in this ren@@ der@@ ing of the flu virus , these different col@@ ored spi@@ kes are what it uses to infe@@ ct you .
large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vac@@ cin@@ es were seen as poor business .
they &apos;re currently making a cock@@ tail -- an anti@@ body cock@@ tail -- that can be used to treat sever@@ e , over@@ wh@@ el@@ ming cases of flu .
for most stra@@ ins , you could get one to two do@@ ses of v@@ acc@@ ine per eg@@ g .
the developing world , mostly left out of the current response , sees the potential of these alterna@@ te technologies and they &apos;re le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g@@ ging the west .
in your gut , do you think it &apos;s probably going to be at least another five years ?
and here &apos;s the un@@ roman@@ tic truth -- and the city air makes you free , they said in ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance germany . so some people go to places like sh@@ ang@@ hai but most go to the squ@@ at@@ ter cities where a@@ es@@ the@@ tics rule .
even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid .
africa &apos;s beg@@ g@@ ing-@@ bow@@ l lea@@ ks .
that characteri@@ zation , in my view , is even more char@@ it@@ able .
by ra@@ king it off the bac@@ ks of their suffering people .
tradition@@ ally , afri@@ cans hate governments . they hate ty@@ ran@@ ny .
they decide what to do .
he &apos;s getting no assi@@ stance from the government , and he &apos;s building a second , bigger boat .
it meant something that would connect us all together .
dan@@ iel didn &apos;t get anything about the prote@@ sts in eg@@ y@@ pt at all in his first page of google results .
it gives us a little bit of ju@@ stin bie@@ ber and a little bit of afghanistan .
we need it to connect us all together .
she took our order , and then went to the couple in the bo@@ oth next to us , and she lo@@ wer@@ ed her voice so much i had to really stra@@ in to hear what she was saying .
it &apos;s like be@@ ach@@ com@@ bing , you know ? every time the ti@@ de comes in and out , you find some more sh@@ ells .
it is easier than you think . it really is .
once it &apos;s a closed system , you will have legal li@@ ability if you do not ur@@ ge your ce@@ o to get the ma@@ x@@ im@@ um income from re@@ duc@@ ing and tra@@ ding the carbon emissions that can be avo@@ i@@ ded . the market will work to solve this problem if we can ac@@ compli@@ sh this .
so we live on the most fra@@ gi@@ le , little so@@ ap bubble you can imagine , a very sac@@ red so@@ ap bubble , but one that is very , very easy to affect .
and one of the really most incredible things , i think , is that there &apos;s nobody out there trying to collect it parts of the ocean there look just absolutely apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic .
but i couldn &apos;t take a sub@@ marine ride -- especially between the time i knew i was coming here and today -- so i had to do a little experiment myself to see if there was oil in the gul@@ f of mexico .
that &apos;s the story of thousands of people .
it &apos;s not like we &apos;re starting with something that &apos;s been okay .
so it &apos;s just absolutely crazy .
and they were allowed to do so because of the absolute failure of over@@ sight of the government that &apos;s supposed to be our government , prote@@ cting us .
we &apos;re either going to have an absolutely un@@ mi@@ tig@@ ated cat@@ astrop@@ he of this oil lea@@ k in the gul@@ f , or we will make the moment we need out of this , as many people have not@@ ed today .
so you may ask -- you may ask me , well how do you know what our energy future is ?
so in about seven years of doing nuclear research , i started out with a dream to make a &quot; star in a j@@ ar , &quot; a star in my garage , and i ended up meeting the president and developing things that i think can change the world , and i think other kids can too .
right . all together now .
now you &apos;ve probably seen pictures of neurons before .
well , we take this three-@@ dimensional st@@ ack of images and treat it as a gigan@@ tic three-@@ dimensional col@@ or@@ ing book .
and , as a scientist , i &apos;m not supposed to talk about my feelings -- too much information , professor .
these signals are called neu@@ ral activity .
well , i pro@@ pose a direct test .
philosop@@ her@@ s know this game very well .
se@@ ba@@ stian se@@ ung is ma@@ pping a massi@@ vely ambi@@ ti@@ ous new model of the brain that foc@@ uses on the connections between each neuron . he calls it our &quot; connec@@ tom@@ e , &quot; and it &apos;s as individual as our genome -- and understanding it could open a new way to understand our brains and our minds .
these things just get him really excited . and so we &apos;re looking at these concep@@ ts , and we were just like , who@@ a , this guy &apos;s good .
now , you see the mag@@ net fell really slowly .
ks : no , not yet .
z@@ k : our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called se@@ k@@ is@@ u@@ i chemical . one of their r &amp; amp ; d engineers was working on a way to make plastic sti@@ ffer .
fresh watch , from inv@@ ent@@ ables da@@ ir@@ y far@@ ms .
ks : thank you .
it makes everything else you put it with taste incredible .
i read about it . it was in le mon@@ de .
amazing .
because he said to me that he felt like the ge@@ ese -- and he pro@@ ved this actually , not just a conc@@ eit , he pro@@ ved this -- the ge@@ ese felt mani@@ pul@@ ated when they were im@@ pris@@ oned in their little pa@@ d@@ do@@ cks .
they get what they want , they leave the rest for me and i sell it .
and we &apos;re sitting there , and i hear &#91; cla@@ pping &#93; from a distance , so i look over .
they find it here .
and i &apos;m not like some super ta@@ ster , you know ?
i fle@@ w home , i &apos;m on the flight with my little black book and i took , you know , pages and pages of notes about it .
the ph@@ ar@@ a@@ oh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
he said , &quot; if all the insects disappe@@ ared , life on earth as we know it would disappe@@ ar within 50 years .
you see , fire made us human ; fossil fu@@ els made us modern .
mor@@ e@@ over , this transition needs no new inven@@ tions and no acts of con@@ gress and no new feder@@ al ta@@ xes , man@@ date sub@@ si@@ dies or laws and running washington gri@@ d@@ lock .
so vehicle fit@@ ness op@@ ens a new automo@@ tive competi@@ tive strategy that can double the oil sav@@ ings over the next 40 years , but then also make electri@@ fication aff@@ ord@@ able , and that dis@@ places the rest of the oil .
instead of just seeing the travel grow , we can use innovative pri@@ cing , char@@ ging for road infrastructure by the mile , not by the gall@@ on .
changing how we make electricity gets easier if we need less of it .
so what do such sav@@ ings mean for the electricity that is three-@@ fif@@ ths used in mot@@ ors ?
actually no gener@@ ator is 24 / 7 . they all break .
so our energy future is not fa@@ te , but choice , and that choice is very flexi@@ ble .
so with the conversation just be@@ gun at rein@@ vent@@ ing@@ fire@@ .com , let me invi@@ te you each to engage with us and with each other , with everyone around you , to help make the world ri@@ cher , fair@@ er , cool@@ er and sa@@ fer by together rein@@ vent@@ ing fire .
second , the development institutions that chan@@ nel@@ ed these trans@@ f@@ ers were op@@ a@@ que , with little transpar@@ ency of what they finan@@ ced or what results they achie@@ ved .
to t@@ ack@@ le this problem , governments are using new tools to visu@@ alize the budget so it &apos;s more under@@ stand@@ able to the public .
we will find that text@@ books and teachers will show up in schools for their children .
after , there is people like me , who try to deser@@ ve to exist , and who are so as@@ ham@@ ed to make this us@@ eless job , who try to do it in another way , and they try , i try , to not make the object for the object but for the result , for the profit for the human being , the person who will use it .
even , i think , we copy our way to re@@ produce , you know what i mean , and something of -- oh no , forget it .
i can explain you . i shall try .
come back . because , after , there is another tra@@ p .
there is different type of bar@@ bar@@ ia .
with billions of people who have been born , worked , lived and died before us , these people who have worked so much , we have now bring beautiful things , beautiful gif@@ ts , we know so many things .
put your arms straight down at your side , look up , open your eyes , st@@ are straight ahead , and speak out your question lou@@ dly so everybody can hear .

they said , &quot; it &apos;s good enough for government work .
and they didn &apos;t care whether you became a doctor or a law@@ yer or a general , and they never expected any gener@@ als in the family , as long as you got an education and then you got a job .
and i would order the hot dog from the guy , and he &apos;d start to fix it , and then he &apos;d look around at the bo@@ dy@@ gu@@ ards and the police cars -- &quot; i &apos;ve got a green card ! i &apos;ve got a green card ! &quot;

the next day i was in ta@@ hri@@ r .
the w@@ inning is the w@@ inning of the dig@@ nity of every single eg@@ yp@@ ti@@ an .
we think , by studying how the sounds are learned , we &apos;ll have a model for the rest of language , and perhaps for critical peri@@ ods that may exist in childhood for social , emotional and cognitive development .
and the distribution of japanese is totally different , where we see a group of inter@@ medi@@ ate sounds , which is known as the japanese &quot; r . &quot;
what it demon@@ strated is that babies take statistics on a new language .
just as the po@@ ets and wri@@ ters described , we &apos;re going to be able to see , i think , that won@@ dr@@ ous open@@ ness , u@@ tter and complete open@@ ness , of the mind of a child .
i agree , it looks pretty amazing .
you wouldn &apos;t paint with sy@@ ring@@ es , but it works just the same .
it goes really fast , and it &apos;s not that impres@@ sive .
and early in the morning , i went into the ward .
they tou@@ ched me when i was four and i lost my e@@ y@@ es@@ ight and was par@@ tially paraly@@ zed .
and what is fascinating is that compassion has ene@@ mi@@ es , and those ene@@ mi@@ es are things like p@@ ity , moral ou@@ tra@@ ge , fear .
and that is the mental quality of equ@@ anim@@ ity .
the women in this room are lot@@ uses in a sea of fire .
so one squ@@ ared is one , two squ@@ ared is four , three squ@@ ared is nine , five squ@@ ared is 25 , and so on .

and then there was me , the ir@@ ani@@ an-@@ american of the group .
his name was j@@ ab@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; i didn &apos;t get the mem@@ o . what &apos;s going on ? &quot;
i &apos;m like , &quot; what are you doing here ? &quot;
so i went down to the lo@@ bby , and i saw this indian guy .
ladies and gentle@@ men , the creation of life .
now where &apos;s the lady ?

because she believed that the only way to un@@ block what , at the time , was known as a blo@@ cked democracy , it@@ al@@ y , a country run by the same party for 35 years was the arms struggle .
this guy thought in the same way i did .
so , every single time that somebody got into a tax@@ i in bel@@ fast without knowing , actually , was fund@@ ing the ir@@ a .
so , this was a vi@@ tal inje@@ ction of c@@ ash into the u.s. economy .
all the bank@@ ers said to their cli@@ ents , &quot; get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else . &quot;
cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tively , i will have ro@@ wed over 8@@ ,000 miles , taken over three million o@@ ar stro@@ kes and spent more than 3@@ 12 days alone on the ocean on a 23 foot ro@@ w@@ boat .
i sat down one day and wrote two ver@@ sions of my own ob@@ it@@ u@@ ary , the one that i wanted , a life of ad@@ vent@@ ure , and the one that i was actually head@@ ing for which was a nice , normal , pleas@@ ant life , but it wasn &apos;t where i wanted to be by the end of my life .
and eventually after 10@@ 3 days at sea , i arrived in anti@@ gu@@ a .
no i don &apos;t . i &apos;m totally self-@@ suppor@@ ting out there .
i lost and got air@@ li@@ f@@ ted .
fortunately , the one that he caught that day was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier .
i found out that people had ro@@ wed across oceans .
i plan on being around for a long time , and when i &apos;m 90 years old , i want to be happy and healthy .
but i really appreci@@ ate being here . and thank you , chris , and also , thank you , de@@ bor@@ ah pat@@ ton , for making this possible .
and so we got this , or we had a choice of that . oh , stop cla@@ pping .
so we &apos;re going to go straight into this .
mean@@ while , instead of sending someone working dra@@ wings , which are those huge sets of blu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts that you &apos;ve seen your whole life , what the architect can do is send a set of assem@@ bly in@@ struc@@ tions , like you used to get when you were a child , when you bought little models that said , &quot; bol@@ t a to b , and c to d . &quot;
now , l@@ est you think that this is only for the light at heart , or just temporary instal@@ lations , this is the same fir@@ m working at the world trade center , re@@ plac@@ ing the bridge that used to go across west street , that very important pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an connection between the city of new york and the re@@ development of the west side .
it &apos;s all about sen@@ su@@ ality . it &apos;s all about touch .
when i was a kid , i hi@@ d my heart under the bed , because my mother said , &quot; if you &apos;re not care@@ ful , some@@ day someone &apos;s going to break it . &quot;
and they said , &quot; don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
when i was 19 , i wrote , &quot; i will love myself despite the e@@ ase with which i le@@ an toward the opposite . &quot;
i &apos;m not the only kid who grew up this way , surro@@ unded by people who used to say that rhy@@ me about sti@@ cks and st@@ ones , as if broken b@@ ones hurt more than the names we got called , and we got called them all .
every school was a big top cir@@ c@@ us tent , and the pe@@ cking order went from ac@@ ro@@ bat@@ s to li@@ on tam@@ ers , from clo@@ w@@ ns to car@@ ni@@ es , all of these miles ahead of who we were .
but it is within our self-@@ interest to understand the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of our lives un@@ to ourselves .
now with the allo@@ c@@ ation and the understanding of the lack of understanding , we enter into a new era of science in which we feel nothing more than so much so as to say that those within themselves , com@@ por@@ ary or non-@@ com@@ por@@ ary , will figu@@ ra@@ tively figure into the fol@@ ding of our non-@@ understanding and our par@@ tial understanding to the networks of which we all draw our source and conclu@@ sions from .
in the bor@@ e@@ al , they are also the home where almost 50 percent of the 800 bird species found in north america mi@@ gra@@ te north to bre@@ ed and raise their young .
and then think of how large that very small section of one mine is .
so far , this is enough tox@@ in to cover the face of la@@ ke e@@ er@@ ie a foot deep .
and we &apos;re doing this on the second largest oil reser@@ ves on the planet .
the world does not need any more pi@@ p@@ el@@ ines to wed our addi@@ ction to fossil fu@@ els .
but origin@@ ally the signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce of the bin@@ di is to symbo@@ li@@ ze the third eye between the spi@@ ritual world and the religious world .
he too is rein@@ vent@@ ing the mini@@ ature tradition .
so for me , a well-@@ cra@@ f@@ ted ba@@ gu@@ ette , fresh out of the o@@ ven , is complex , but a cur@@ ry oni@@ on green o@@ live po@@ pp@@ y che@@ ese bread is complicated .
the cir@@ cl@@ ed no@@ de is the one we &apos;re trying to influence -- popular support for the government .
now this is a totally reas@@ on@@ able assu@@ mption , given that i have made quite a hab@@ it of encoura@@ ging people to spend more time playing games .
a recent study from &#91; university of mi@@ ch@@ ig@@ an &#93; showed that these games are incredibly powerful relation@@ shi@@ p-@@ management tools .
it happens to one in three , and it happened to me .
and soon i started hearing from people all over the world who were adop@@ ting their own secret identity , rec@@ ru@@ iting their own al@@ lies , and they were getting &quot; super better &quot; facing challenges like cancer and chr@@ onic pain , depression and cro@@ hn &apos;s disease .
now this is interesting , right ?
i want you to sna@@ p your fing@@ ers exactly 50 times , or count back@@ wards from 100 by seven , like this : 100 , 9@@ 3 ...
it &apos;s my favorite super@@ better trick , so keep it up .
you can use your first wish to wish for a million more wi@@ sh@@ es .
the tot@@ ality of this project invol@@ ves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women .
and to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the chicago cultural center &apos;s 3,000 square foot g@@ aller@@ y .
in 199@@ 7 a mathemati@@ cian at cor@@ n@@ ell , da@@ ina ta@@ im@@ ina , made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in kni@@ tting and cro@@ ch@@ et .
what do we mean to talk about a straight line on a cur@@ ved surface ?
what did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this ?
they said , &quot; well i guess there aren &apos;t that many mathemati@@ cians sitting around looking at sea s@@ lu@@ gs . &quot;
and kinder@@ garten was actually a very form@@ alized system of education , establi@@ shed by a man named frie@@ dr@@ ich fro@@ e@@ bel , who was a cr@@ y@@ st@@ allo@@ graph@@ er in the 19@@ th century .
what you get is a highly sel@@ ec@@ tive loss of one function , with other fun@@ ctions being preser@@ ved in@@ t@@ act , and this gives you some confidence in as@@ ser@@ ting that that part of the brain is somehow involved in medi@@ ating that function .
thank god , or you would all be sex@@ ually ar@@ ous@@ ed when you saw your mother .
you start swe@@ ating to dis@@ si@@ pa@@ te the heat that you &apos;re going to create from mus@@ cular exer@@ tion .
by the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an ad@@ jac@@ ent room -- phones him -- and he pi@@ cks up the phone , and he says , &quot; wow , mom , how are you ? where are you ? &quot;
but however , about half the patients , this doesn &apos;t happen .
well , we said , what if you now send the comm@@ and to the phan@@ tom , but give him visual feedback that it &apos;s o@@ be@@ ying his comm@@ and , right ?
i said , &quot; move your normal hand . &quot;
it &apos;s disappe@@ ared . &quot;
five is blue , seven is yellow , eight is char@@ tre@@ use , nine is indi@@ go , ok ?
so , every time you see a number , you see a cor@@ respon@@ ding color , and that &apos;s why you get syn@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
different shapes for different ph@@ on@@ em@@ es , right ?
and i &apos;m happy most of the time , because i think this is the happ@@ i@@ est species on the planet .
but there are a lot of simil@@ ari@@ ties .
one discovery was that wild bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s often walk bi@@ d@@ pe@@ d@@ ally .
these are happy vo@@ c@@ ali@@ zations .
reali@@ zing that n@@ y@@ ota might get hurt , pan@@ ban@@ ish@@ a , like any human mother , carefully tu@@ gs to get the sc@@ is@@ sor@@ s back .
now she comes up to dr . sue and starts writing again .
so we want to create an environment in which bon@@ o@@ bo@@ s , like all of the individuals with whom they are inter@@ acting -- we want to create an environment in which they have fun , and an environment in which the others are meaning@@ ful individuals for them .
we &apos;re learning how to become like them .
if we go beyond our solar system , we &apos;ve learned that the stars aren &apos;t t@@ win@@ k@@ ly points of light .
stars are fu@@ el@@ ed by how the nu@@ cle@@ i in those atoms re@@ act together .
it would take as many human bodies to make up the sun as there are atoms in each of us .
first , any scientific discovery has ben@@ ig@@ n consequences as well as dangerous ones .
if you represent the earth &apos;s lifetime by a single year , say from janu@@ ary when it was made to dec@@ ember , the 21@@ st-@@ century would be a quar@@ ter of a second in jun@@ e -- a tiny fra@@ ction of the year .
but could they have predi@@ cted this un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented spi@@ ke less than hal@@ f@@ way through the earth &apos;s life ?
so they have more de@@ bt and worse friend@@ ships than they had before they won the lot@@ ter@@ y .
and we mani@@ pul@@ ated how much money we gave them .
of course , these are under@@ gradu@@ ates in canada -- not the world &apos;s most repres@@ ent@@ ative population .
i dro@@ ve to the m@@ all in my car , bought a present , gave it to my mom . &quot;
i know you &apos;re all looking at that red country in the middle .
and basically that if he doesn &apos;t show me that it works here , i don &apos;t believe anything he said .
thank you .
now , did all of this end with the islam@@ ic revolution in 197@@ 9 ?
a few years later , the ir@@ ani@@ ans sent a com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive negoti@@ ation pro@@ pos@@ al to the bush admini@@ stration , a pro@@ pos@@ al that reve@@ aled that there was some potential of getting iran and israel back on terms again .
so , today i &apos;m back just to show you a few things , to show you , in fact , there is an open data movement af@@ o@@ ot , now , around the world .
and i &apos;m deli@@ gh@@ ted to see a great competition between the u.k. in blue , and the u.s. in red .
the light blue is re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps these volunte@@ ers had spo@@ tt@@ ed from the &#91; satelli@@ te images &#93; .
and number two , obviously , this depen@@ dence upon the le@@ sters is going to produce a sub@@ tle , under@@ st@@ ated , we could say cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged , ben@@ ding to keep the le@@ sters happy .
so here too we have a democracy , a democracy depen@@ dent upon the f@@ under@@ s and depen@@ dent upon the people , compe@@ ting depen@@ den@@ cies , possibly confli@@ cting depen@@ den@@ cies depen@@ ding upon who the f@@ under@@ s are .
if we der@@ e@@ gu@@ late these guys , how are we going to raise money from them ? &quot;
we will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first .
when connec@@ tic@@ ut adop@@ ted this system , in the very first year , 7@@ 8 percent of ele@@ cted repres@@ ent@@ a@@ tives gave up large contribu@@ tions and took small contribu@@ tions only .
a re@@ public . a repres@@ ent@@ ative democracy .
it explo@@ ded an arms race .
maybe you thought that was sc@@ ary , but actually there &apos;s no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you &apos;re jes@@ us chr@@ ist .
so it wasn &apos;t all the good side of the illness .
so what do we make of that ? first of all , we know that you &apos;re all brilliant .
and only today is science starting to figure out how it works .
you &apos;ll see -- let &apos;s see , it &apos;s coming up possibly at the very end -- maybe not .
the combin@@ ed light from these be@@ et@@ les -- these are actually tiny be@@ et@@ les -- is so bright that fis@@ her@@ men out at sea can use them as navi@@ g@@ ating be@@ ac@@ ons to find their way back to their home ri@@ vers . it &apos;s stun@@ ning .
hold your breath for me .
all right . so before any one goes out of syn@@ c , i &apos;ll just put those right there .
intervie@@ wer : this much ? boy : yeah .
intervie@@ wer : right . so it was quite small -- engineer : yes . intervie@@ wer : -- but real ?
intervie@@ wer : so you &apos;ve got to put your feet out si@@ de@@ ways .
now , i know that many of you don &apos;t stop to think about diversity in agri@@ cultural systems and , let &apos;s face it , that &apos;s logi@@ cal .
find it . make sure it doesn &apos;t join the list . &quot;
i want to show you two sli@@ des , but first , i want to tell you that we &apos;ve been working at the global cro@@ p diversity trust with a number of scientists -- particularly at stanford and university of washington -- to ask the question : what &apos;s going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of tra@@ its and characteri@@ stics do we need in our agri@@ cultural cro@@ ps to be able to ada@@ pt to this ?
now , the good news is that we have conser@@ ved .
and here &apos;s the front door of this facili@@ ty .
i can &apos;t look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a solution for climate change , for the water crisis .
we are going to talk today about the sequ@@ el of &quot; in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent truth . &quot;
you are great . this is the cor@@ rect post@@ ure .
invest@@ or and pr@@ ank@@ ster yo@@ ss@@ i var@@ di deli@@ vers a ball@@ sy lec@@ ture on the dan@@ gers of blog@@ ging . specifically , for men .
so we , by making a whole bunch of attemp@@ ts , thousands of attemp@@ ts , in that four@@ -@@ year time period , we invented the concep@@ ts of the air@@ planes that we fly today . and that &apos;s why they &apos;re so safe , as we gave it a lot of chance to find what &apos;s good .
this thing was designed three years after g@@ ag@@ ar@@ in first fle@@ w in space in 196@@ 1 .
there &apos;s another one announ@@ ced just last week .
paul allen , el@@ an mus@@ k , richard bran@@ son , je@@ ff be@@ z@@ os , the ans@@ ar@@ i family , which is now fund@@ ing the russi@@ ans &apos; sub-@@ or@@ b@@ ital thing , bob bi@@ gel@@ o@@ w , a private space station , and car@@ ma@@ ck .
it &apos;s commercial . it can be defined as space tour@@ ism . they are also off@@ ering a trip to go on this whi@@ p around the moon , like apo@@ ll@@ o 8 was done .
why is this happening ?
now , i think , in fact , we &apos;re at a turning point in human history , where we can finally now re@@ build many of the institutions of the industrial age around a new set of principles .
your most pre@@ cious as@@ set goes out the el@@ ev@@ ator every night .
and we need a lot of sun@@ light in this trou@@ bled world .
but in the tun@@ isi@@ an revolution , the new media didn &apos;t cause the revolution ; it was caused by in@@ justice .
it was a@@ gr@@ arian , and the means of production and political system was called feu@@ d@@ alism , and knowledge was concent@@ r@@ ated in the church and the no@@ bility .
now , this thing has a function .
the revolution is called angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is , and it &apos;s based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
now i &apos;m going to focus on cancer because angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is is a hall@@ mark of cancer , every type of cancer .
and we can do this because tumor blood ves@@ sel@@ s are unlike normal , healthy ves@@ sel@@ s we see in other places of the body : they &apos;re ab@@ normal ; they &apos;re very poor@@ ly constru@@ cted ; and , because of that , they &apos;re highly vulnerable to treat@@ ments that target them .
now , obviously , anti@@ angi@@ ogen@@ ic therapy could be used for a wide range of can@@ cers .
so let me show you what happens when we put in an extra@@ ct from red gra@@ pes .
and that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
so this approach that we &apos;re taking for cancer pre@@ ven@@ tion may also have an app@@ lic@@ ation for o@@ bes@@ ity .
willi@@ am l@@ i pres@@ ents a new way to think about tre@@ ating cancer and other diseases : anti-@@ angi@@ ogen@@ es@@ is , pre@@ vent@@ ing the growth of blood ves@@ sel@@ s that feed a tumor . the cru@@ cial first step : eating can@@ cer@@ -@@ fighting fo@@ ods that cut off the supply lines and beat cancer at its own game .
i read martin gar@@ d@@ ner &apos;s colum@@ ns in scientific american .
this is called a figu@@ re-@@ ground illusion .
and so i think a lot about interaction .
now , this one is a little bit tri@@ ck@@ ier .
there is only one solution . it &apos;s not that hard .
there is also a trend towards games that are good for you .
oh , yeah . there , okay . j@@ -@@ o and -- i guess that &apos;s that part . we got the bo@@ w . that bo@@ w helps .
and then let &apos;s remember that we &apos;ve been taught the ex@@ act opposite by the power@@ s that be , that compassion clou@@ ds your thinking , that it gets in the way , that vulner@@ ability is we@@ ak@@ ness , that emotions are not to be tru@@ sted , and you &apos;re not supposed to take things personally , which is one of my favor@@ ites .
when i spent my first weeks at pan@@ z@@ i hospital i sat with women who sat and lin@@ ed up every day to tell me their stories .
and they were all alone , and i thought , &quot; this is the secret life of men . &quot;
and i have to now share a few stories of girls i &apos;ve seen across the planet who have enga@@ ged their girl , who have taken on their girl in spi@@ te of all the circum@@ stances around them .
so , for years ag@@ nes walked through the ri@@ ft valley .
she imag@@ ined her father killing her on one hand , and mama ag@@ nes gre@@ eting her , with the hope that she would gre@@ et her when she got to the house .
i was asking girls if they like being a girl , and all the girls were like , &quot; no , i hate it . i can &apos;t stand it .
it &apos;s like the older women somehow for@@ got .
i love , i love , love , love being a girl !
which of those parents here in the room might not lie concern@@ ing the where@@ ab@@ ou@@ ts of your son or daughter in an investig@@ ation of a killing ?
and then take photographs , and this is what the scene looked like at the time of the sho@@ ot@@ ing from the position of the teena@@ gers looking at the car going by and sho@@ ot@@ ing .
that &apos;s 30 feet away .
he and his son are both atten@@ ding cal state , long beach right now taking clas@@ ses .
so he realized he had a set whose number of elements was larger than infin@@ ity .
so here &apos;s the second i@@ ter@@ ation , and the third , fourth and so on .
now , after i did the simulation , i realized the whole village kind of spir@@ als around , just like this , and here &apos;s that replic@@ ating line -- a self-@@ replic@@ ating line that un@@ fol@@ ds into the fra@@ c@@ tal .
and three times , the answer is no .
so this is very conscious knowledge .
and i started expla@@ ining why i was there in africa , and they got very excited when they saw the c@@ ant@@ or set .
and i know brian en@@ o says there &apos;s not enough africa in computers , but you know , i don &apos;t think there &apos;s enough african history in brian en@@ o .
these are ways of doing self-@@ organization -- of doing entreprene@@ ur@@ ship -- that are gent@@ le , that are eg@@ al@@ it@@ arian .
i want to tell you about one family that i met , and why i think they offer clu@@ es .
su@@ ther@@ land wanted to create a system where ideas didn &apos;t just per@@ col@@ ate down but could per@@ col@@ ate up from the bottom and be ad@@ ju@@ sted in real time .
so i turned to david : &quot; so why does it work ? &quot;
now look , naturally there &apos;s a gap between their kind of condu@@ ct in these meetings and their behavior the rest of the week , but the truth is it didn &apos;t really bo@@ ther us .
i &apos;m not home , can &apos;t make family dinner ?
just yesterday , we were having our family meeting , and we had vot@@ ed to work on over@@ re@@ acting .
adap@@ t@@ ability is fine , but we also need bedro@@ ck .
another great way to tell your story is to tell your children where they came from .
he still lies there today , covered in a layer of green gr@@ ass .
a fres@@ h@@ ly wa@@ x@@ ed car , the water molecules sl@@ um@@ p to about 90 degrees .
so imagine how something like this could help revolution@@ ize your field of work .
anyway , i like op@@ ra@@ h -- i like her gir@@ l@@ friend@@ y-@@ ness , i like her weight issues , i like how she &apos;s trans@@ formed talk television , i like how she &apos;s brought reading back to america -- but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... i call it the so@@ on-@@ y@@ i moment : it is the moment when i cannot continue suppor@@ ting someone .
ni@@ kol@@ a tes@@ la : the result is 1@@ 18@@ ,@@ 2@@ 3@@ 6 .
ill@@ umin@@ ating the city was only the beginning .
so i am indeed a neuro@@ surge@@ on , and i follow a long tradition of neuro@@ surgery , and what i &apos;m going to tell you about today is ad@@ ju@@ sting the di@@ als in the circu@@ its in the brain , being able to go anywhere in the brain and turning areas of the brain up or down to help our patients .
so what we &apos;re doing is plac@@ ing these electro@@ des throughout the brain .
five of them have dy@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
so we wonder@@ ed , can we place electro@@ des in this area of sa@@ dness and see if we can turn down the ther@@ mo@@ st@@ at , can we turn down the activity , and what will be the con@@ sequence of that ?
can we get those areas of the brain to use gl@@ u@@ co@@ se once again ?
contr@@ ary to calcu@@ lations made by some engineers , bees can fly , dolph@@ ins can swim , and ge@@ ck@@ os can even clim@@ b up the smo@@ o@@ th@@ est sur@@ faces . now , what i want to do , in the short time i have , is to try to allow each of you to experience the thri@@ ll of reve@@ aling nature &apos;s design .
they all work like this kan@@ g@@ aro@@ o , they boun@@ ce .
and here &apos;s one example that &apos;s really exciting .
it didn &apos;t de@@ cre@@ ase its pre@@ fer@@ red speed at all .
how do they do this ? they have bizar@@ re to@@ es . they have to@@ es that un@@ cur@@ l like party favor@@ s when you b@@ low them out , and then pe@@ el off the surface , like ta@@ pe .
the animal does not use that .
what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re taking that inspiration of the ha@@ irs , and with another collea@@ gue at ber@@ k@@ ele@@ y , we &apos;re manufacturing them .
and even in the non-@@ profit world , a world we sometimes think of as being led by more women , women at the top : 20 percent .
now , at the out@@ set , i want to be very clear that this speech comes with no jud@@ g@@ ments .
my brother is kind of bus@@ y .
i wish i could tell that to my daughter .
i said , okay , and she sat down , and we talked .
and if that wasn &apos;t good enough motivation for everyone out there , they also have more -- how shall i say this on this stage ? -- they know each other more in the bibli@@ cal sense as well .
my generation really , sa@@ dly , is not going to change the numbers at the top .
we talk about it in terms of engagement , or non-@@ compli@@ ance .
they said that they could have infe@@ ctions that would spread from their ja@@ ws to other parts of their bodies , and ultimately , yes , they would lose their teeth .
this is a campaign from the american diabetes associ@@ ation .
we either keep going fast , or we slow down .
so this is a different approach .
what we did at wired was we went , and i got our graphic design department to re-@@ imagine these lab repor@@ ts .
so we take the b@@ old step of putting the cho@@ le@@ ster@@ ol information on the same page , which is the way the doctor is going to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate it .
it &apos;s an incredibly powerful cat@@ aly@@ st to change .
it &apos;s a simple idea about nature .
and the be@@ e has been cle@@ ver@@ ly fo@@ ol@@ ed into taking the ne@@ ct@@ ar , and also pi@@ cking up some po@@ w@@ der on its leg , and going off to the next blo@@ s@@ so@@ m .
as an intellectual matter , looking at the world from other species &apos; points of view helps us deal with this weird an@@ om@@ al@@ y , which is -- and this is in the real@@ m of intellectual history -- which is that we have this dar@@ win@@ ian revolution 150 years ago ...
and that &apos;s really what i do as a writer , as a stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller , is try to make people feel what we know and tell stories that actually help us think e@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cally .
they gra@@ ze everything down , inten@@ sive gra@@ zing .
so when they lose a lot of lea@@ f mass , they shed roots ; they kind of cau@@ teri@@ ze them and the roots die .
because while the last decade was the decade of social and the decade of where the frame@@ work in which we connect with other people was built , this next decade will be the decade where the game frame@@ work is built , where the mo@@ ti@@ va@@ tions that we use to actually influence behavior , and the frame@@ work in which that is constru@@ cted , is decided upon , and that &apos;s really important .
and so when you want to build on the social layer , the frame@@ work has been decided ; it is the open graph ap@@ i .
this sort of loss of free will that occur@@ s in games can be fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , so with each dynamic , i &apos;m going to give three examples : one that shows how this is already being used in the real world , so you can sort of ration@@ alize it a little bit ; one that shows it in what we consider a conven@@ tional game -- i think everything is a game , but this is sort of more of a what you would think is a game played on a board or on a computer screen , and then one how this can be used for good , so we can see that these forces can really be very powerful .
this is one that isn &apos;t a game yet , but really should be .
but let &apos;s use it consci@@ ously . like why have games that you can lose ?
they go places , they do challenges , they ear@@ n points .
and so , i &apos;ve got about 20 seconds left , so if i &apos;m going to leave you with anything , last decade was the decade of social .
and they &apos;re lab@@ el@@ ed by color right now , by language .
now what i would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like .
in fact , many of the organizations that are here -- the ac@@ u@@ men fund , i think ap@@ prote@@ c we have running , i &apos;m not sure if that one &apos;s up yet -- and many of the people who have pres@@ ented here are running through google gr@@ ants .
and they spread , actually , very quickly , even outside the u.@@ s .
and this is how we keep our innovation running .
google answers is something we started , which is really cool , which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars , you can type a question in , and then there &apos;s a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you , and it &apos;s guar@@ an@@ te@@ ed and all that , and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself .
one of the things that really exc@@ ites me about what we &apos;re doing now is we have this thing called ad@@ sense , and this is a little bit for@@ es@@ ha@@ do@@ wing -- this is from before de@@ an dro@@ pped out .
so we decided -- actually , the high@@ light &apos;s right there . oh , thank you .
i &apos;d like to talk a little bit this morning about what happens if we move from design to design thinking .
now , this was back in the 19@@ th century .
what makes life easier , more enjo@@ y@@ able ?
par@@ tly they did this by instead of building a fan@@ cy new factory , they used the bas@@ ement of one of their hospit@@ als .
now , br@@ un@@ el worked at the hei@@ ght of the industrial revolution , when all of life and our economy was being rein@@ v@@ ented .
and the same process is just getting under@@ way with n@@ gos in east africa .
but i really like my te@@ a swe@@ et . &quot;
in america , the primary loc@@ us of choice is the individual .
or , you could say that the individual &apos;s pre@@ fer@@ ences were sha@@ ped by the pre@@ fer@@ ences of specific others .
you know , research shows repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly that we can &apos;t actually tell the difference between co@@ ke and pe@@ p@@ s@@ i .
choice no longer off@@ ers opportunities , but im@@ pos@@ es con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts .
but there was a big difference .
americans have so often tried to dis@@ se@@ min@@ ate their ideas of choice , belie@@ ving that they will be , or ought to be , wel@@ com@@ ed with open he@@ arts and minds .
and i can &apos;t decide .
she@@ en@@ a i@@ y@@ en@@ gar : the art of cho@@ o@@ sing
so i built this small sa@@ iling robot with the ru@@ d@@ der at the front , and i was trying to pull something very long and heavy , so that &apos;s a four@@ -@@ me@@ ter-@@ long object just to pull , and i was surprised with just a 14@@ -@@ centi@@ meter ru@@ d@@ der , i could control four meters of absor@@ b@@ ent .
a fish will move because -- by changing like this , but our boat is prop@@ ell@@ ed by the wind still , and the h@@ ul@@ l contro@@ ls the tra@@ je@@ c@@ tory .
we were pe@@ er-@@ learning , we were engineering , we were making things , prototyp@@ ing , but most importantly we were trying our prototyp@@ es in the water as often as possible , to fail as quickly as possible , to learn from .
c@@ es@@ ar har@@ ada : a no@@ vel idea for cle@@ an@@ ing up oil sp@@ ills
i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff .
so , what i &apos;d like to ask is , if the computer is becoming a princi@@ p@@ al tool of media and enter@@ tainment , how did we get here ?
ph : you know , so much was worked out : the first re@@ al-@@ time interaction , the video display , poin@@ ting a gun . it lead to the micro@@ computer , but unfortunately , it was too pri@@ ce@@ y for the na@@ vy , and all of this would have been lost if it weren &apos;t for a happy co@@ inci@@ dence .
to build that , what we &apos;d do with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind technology is we &apos;d have to take up roughly from the 10 to mul@@ h@@ oll@@ and , and from the 4@@ 0@@ 5 to la ci@@ en@@ eg@@ a just with those wh@@ ir@@ l@@ win@@ ds .

but what was important is , the go@@ th@@ ic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form .
so , in architecture we deal with big assem@@ bli@@ es of components , so there might be up to , say , 50,000 pieces of material in this room you &apos;re sitting in right now that all need to get organized .
in terms of construction and manufacturing , this is a kilome@@ ter-@@ long h@@ ous@@ ing block that was built in the &apos; 7@@ 0s in am@@ ster@@ dam .
so , we designed a system here of eight cur@@ ves that could be swa@@ pped , very similar to that h@@ ous@@ ing project i showed you , and we could re@@ com@@ bine those together , so that we always had er@@ gon@@ om@@ ic shapes that always had the same volu@@ me and could always be produced in the same way .

why don &apos;t we know some of these things a little bit better ?

in this case , at these is@@ lands , you know , cor@@ als are instru@@ ment@@ al-@@ quality recor@@ ders of change in the water .
you know , that &apos;s the strength of our argument , that we are doing something that &apos;s truly different .
you have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today .
so einstein found that the medium that trans@@ mit@@ s gravity is space itself .
so kal@@ u@@ za said , well , maybe there are more dimensions of space .
so , if we take a look , say , at space itself -- i can only show , of course , two dimensions on a screen .
deep inside any of these particles , there is something else .
first is , many of us believe that these extra dimensions hold the answer to what perhaps is the deep@@ est question in theore@@ tical physics , theore@@ tical science .
so let me bring some str@@ ings into the story .
einstein comes along and says , well , space and time can war@@ p and cur@@ ve -- that &apos;s what gravity is .
and yet , even at this most fundamental level , context is everything .
the one on the right comes from a yellow surface , in sha@@ dow , ori@@ ented facing the left , vie@@ wed through a pin@@ k@@ ish medium .
so let me show you how quickly our brains can re@@ define normal@@ ity , even at the simpl@@ est thing the brain does , which is color .
and the same thing over on the right .
now i want you to keep looking at it .
and now , in this experiment they get re@@ war@@ ded if they go to the blue flo@@ wers .
on the left is what his camera sees .
and what we have here -- can everyone see 25 pur@@ ple sur@@ faces on your left , and 25 , call it yel@@ lo@@ wish , sur@@ faces on your right ?
there aren &apos;t a lot of good words for the concep@@ ts we &apos;re going to talk about .
yet it seems , again and again , that we &apos;re hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly bad at it .
there &apos;s the avail@@ ability heu@@ ri@@ stic , which basically means we esti@@ mate the prob@@ ability of something by how easy it is to bring in@@ stances of it to mind .

and that &apos;s one reason why that organization probably is the best in@@ formed key player to understand modern conflict -- because they talk .
if we talk to them , we may legi@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze them . &quot;
now south african friends will know that was very pain@@ ful .
it is going to demand an inclu@@ sive process of diplo@@ ma@@ cy very different from the one we are practic@@ ing today as we are head@@ ing to new ro@@ unds of difficult climate negoti@@ ations , but when we move toward something which has to be much more along a bro@@ ad mobili@@ zation .
and unfortunately , i can be a little too honest .

and this is what it &apos;s like to find a ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus re@@ x , which i was lucky enough to do a few years ago .
it &apos;s true .
i want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on -- and then talk about something you haven &apos;t heard so much about , which is prote@@ om@@ ics .

there is , in fact , another stage .
we &apos;re great ! who is not great ? england ! &quot;

i &apos;m going to read a few stri@@ ps .
it &apos;s why they leave lights on around the house .
it was not until the 14@@ th century that an itali@@ an pain@@ ter recogni@@ zed the la@@ p as a gre@@ cian temp@@ le , u@@ ph@@ ol@@ ster@@ ed in fl@@ es@@ h and cl@@ oth .

and it &apos;s too cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l to anima@@ te gu@@ ts and he@@ arts and behavior when the going gets r@@ ough .
and in that light , for the religious , compassion also brings us into the terri@@ tory of myster@@ y -- encoura@@ ging us not just to see beauty , but perhaps also to look for the face of god in the moment of suffering , in the face of a stran@@ ger , in the face of the vi@@ br@@ ant religious other .
je@@ an v@@ ani@@ er says that his work , like the work of other people -- his great , belo@@ ved , late friend mother ter@@ es@@ a -- is never in the first instance about changing the world ; it &apos;s in the first instance about changing ourselves .

it &apos;s different from being sh@@ y .
and this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the hel@@ m , not because they enjo@@ yed direc@@ ting others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
this is no surprise though if you look at the insi@@ ghts of con@@ temporary psych@@ ology .
and they fe@@ ature as their role models really great sal@@ es@@ men .
and even away from the po@@ dium , when you called him to say hell@@ o , he would often end the conversation pre@@ ma@@ tur@@ ely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
this is especially important for ex@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted children too .
and then i &apos;ll come back to the beginning , and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today &apos;s world , it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about , but to have a passion for something that is meaning@@ ful .
so , one of our passi@@ ons in our company , and now one of my personal passi@@ ons , is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful , acc@@ essi@@ ble and aff@@ ord@@ able .
as a matter of fact , we think reach@@ ing 100 percent is very do@@ able , even before the 20@@ 15 ti@@ me@@ frame . in other parts of emerging countries , such as india and china , the progress has been good -- has been soli@@ d , has been good . but in places that are not as developed , places like africa , la@@ tin america and other places in the world , the progress has been rather slow . as a matter of fact , i was just recently vis@@ iting south africa .
what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world , the government plays a key role in the development of technology .
one example of this has been the one laptop per child .
you have to be a better husband than i was , because that &apos;s how you make progress . &quot; and now he began to make sense .
i meet a lot of people who are very smart , and say , &quot; but why can &apos;t i figure out my problems ? &quot;
i started it with one other family in 19@@ 80 .
and i asked this guy , i said , &quot; well , do you believe that human beings are responsible to make the world a little bit better place for the next generation ?
i don &apos;t own a gu@@ es@@ thou@@ se .

and i don &apos;t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &apos;t go .
her mother had not gone to primary school .
and somewhere in the middle of south da@@ k@@ ota , i turn to my friend and i ask her a question that &apos;s been bo@@ ther@@ ing me for 2,000 miles .
and finally , i want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative lea@@ p you can make .
but there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
well the wrong side of her body is in ban@@ da@@ ges because the surge@@ on has per@@ formed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
the mira@@ cle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
when it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
and to me , if you really want to re@@ discover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terri@@ fied space of ri@@ ght@@ ness and look around at each other and look out at the va@@ st@@ ness and complexity and myster@@ y of the universe and be able to say , &quot; wow , i don &apos;t know .
one of the ir@@ on@@ ies of this whole system is we &apos;re discus@@ sing what to do about a system that we don &apos;t understand . we don &apos;t even know what oil is . we don &apos;t know where oil comes from . i mean , literally , it &apos;s still a source of debate what this black river of stuff is and where it comes from . the best assu@@ mption , and one of the best gu@@ esses in this stuff , is that this stuff comes out of this stuff , that these things absor@@ b sun@@ light , rot under pressure for millions of years , and you get these black ri@@ vers .
what is this ? this is the first transp@@ l@@ ant of na@@ ked dna , where you take an entire dna operating system out of one cell , ins@@ ert it into a different cell , and have that cell boot up as a separate species . that &apos;s one month old . you will see stuff in the next month that will be just as important as this stuff .
i happened to buy that mot@@ el about three months after vi@@ vi@@ an started working there .
but given my be@@ fu@@ dd@@ led state of mind , i ended up in the self-@@ help section very quickly .
they didn &apos;t even see the in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble stuff higher up the pyrami@@ d .
so as i spent time with leaders in the g@@ n@@ h movement , i got to really understand what they &apos;re doing .
actually , in fact , if you look in the dic@@ tion@@ ary , many dic@@ tion@@ aries define pur@@ suit as to &quot; ch@@ ase with ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty . &quot;
we &apos;re asking 10 simple questions -- it is simpli@@ city .
in fact , as leaders , what we need to learn is that we can influence the quality of that unit of production by creating the conditions for our employees to live their calling .
b@@ l : all right . one , two , three .
right ? if you go down below on a boat , your inner e@@ ars are you telling you you &apos;re moving . your eyes , because it &apos;s moving in regi@@ ster with the boat , say i &apos;m standing still .

b@@ l : &quot; can you help me , henry ? &quot; what good scientist says that , right ?

this is the world -- there won &apos;t be you as a pilot . and i know the pil@@ ots in the audience aren &apos;t going to like that -- and i &apos;ve had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there , flying around and experi@@ en@@ cing that .
wonderful engine .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ three percent said , &quot; yes , as soon as possible . &quot;
wir@@ es su@@ ck , they really do .
what dr . sol@@ jac@@ ic figured out how to do was separate the co@@ ils in a trans@@ former to a greater distance than the size of those trans@@ form@@ ers using this technology , which is not dis@@ similar from the way an oper@@ a sing@@ er sh@@ at@@ ters a glass on the other side of the room .
and then finally , electric vehi@@ cles .
imagine , you get one of these things . you want to hang them on the wall .
and no@@ ki@@ a as well .
so what happens to all these tox@@ ins when we die ?
we want to eat , not be e@@ aten by , our food .
thank you .
we followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn &apos;t do .
they &apos;re ex@@ o@@ tic . they &apos;re experiment@@ al .
so what do we make of all of this ?
it &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in den@@ ial . &quot;
ho@@ spi@@ ce was for people who were dying , and ter@@ ence wasn &apos;t dying .
it &apos;s part of our dna as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our health@@ care system -- doctors , patients , in@@ sur@@ ance companies , us , started accoun@@ ting for the power of that hope .
well , we collect data from satelli@@ tes , from air@@ planes , from ground vehi@@ cles , from people .
this process is a very calcul@@ ated process .
microsoft &apos;s ste@@ phen law@@ ler gives a wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind tour of virtual earth , moving up , down and through its hyper@@ -@@ real c@@ it@@ y@@ scap@@ es with da@@ zz@@ l@@ ingly flu@@ idi@@ ty , a remarkable fe@@ at that requires st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing amounts of data to bring into focus .
you need also state ow@@ ner@@ ship , especially of land asse@@ ts , in order to build and roll out infra@@ structures very quickly .
this is a very little known fact about the two countries .
by that compar@@ ison , democracy looks very , very good in terms of economic growth .
this is the world development inde@@ x indic@@ ator data in the early 199@@ 0s .
these are the two pictures taken of gar@@ ment fac@@ tor@@ ies in gu@@ ang@@ d@@ ong pro@@ vin@@ ce and gar@@ ment fac@@ tor@@ ies in india .
but ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , the system has moved in a more liber@@ al direction , moved in a more democratic direction .
i believe that the political re@@ forms are a must for china to main@@ tain its growth .
i &apos;ve been spending a lot of time thinking about co@@ ffe@@ e@@ houses for the last five years , because i &apos;ve been kind of on this qu@@ est to investig@@ ate this question of where good ideas come from .
and what they noticed was they don &apos;t have a lot of d@@ v@@ rs , they don &apos;t have a lot of micro@@ waves , but they seem to do a pretty good job of keeping their cars on the road .
this is what your office should look like , is part of my message here .
and darwin kept these cop@@ i@@ ous not@@ e@@ books where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hun@@ ch .
and so they ask around to a couple of their colleagues , and everybody &apos;s like , &quot; no , i hadn &apos;t thought of doing that .
could you go the other way ?
this shift is the most stri@@ king in the u.s. and in the u.k. , but it &apos;s a global phenomenon .
so we &apos;re living in the age of sur@@ ging income ine@@ quality , especially at the top .
we have super@@ star bank@@ ers .
again , this is no m@@ ere hypo@@ the@@ tical .
the dy@@ stop@@ ia that wor@@ ries me is a universe in which a few geni@@ uses inv@@ ent google and its il@@ k and the rest of us are emplo@@ yed giving them mas@@ sages .
there &apos;s many of them up there .
one in a hundred .
and this one &apos;s the biggest growth industry of all , and at least six out of 10 of the people in this room will die in this form , which is the d@@ wind@@ ling of capacity with increasing fra@@ il@@ ty , and fra@@ il@@ ty &apos;s an ine@@ vi@@ table part of aging , and increasing fra@@ il@@ ty is in fact the main thing that people die of now , and the last few years , or the last year of your life is spent with a great deal of dis@@ ability , unfortunately .
the small idea is , let &apos;s all of us engage more with this in the way that j@@ as@@ on has illu@@ strated .
it de@@ pri@@ ves eu@@ than@@ asia of its oxygen supply .
my family was on a road trip and we were in the grand c@@ any@@ on .
and this is really what i want to talk to you about today -- about cancer .
so , this really changed my view of looking at cancer .
tumor cells can travel through the blood ves@@ sel@@ s .
so , is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skelet@@ al muscle tissue , but once in contact inside the skelet@@ al muscle tissue , m@@ yo@@ d acts upon these tumor cells and causes them to become skelet@@ al muscle cells ?
and the grandmother had never let any west@@ ern@@ ers ever see her .
and remember this picture , because i &apos;m going to show you another picture later , but you can see how much she looks like her grandmother , although she looks so western .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m 28 years old , and i live in hot@@ els , and i &apos;m not married . &quot;
so , i went back to korea , and i went back to hy@@ un@@ -@@ so@@ ok &apos;s village , and she was gone .
and the more i tried talking to him , the less friend@@ ly he was getting .
i just think that -- what little i know about the situation , she has very little chance here of having the kind of life that you probably would like her to have . &quot;
and he said , &quot; the second day she was here she made up a list of all of the names of the older kids and the yo@@ unger kids .
and the third night , we came back , we &apos;d just gone out to dinner , where you saw the pictures , and we got to the front des@@ k and the guy at the front des@@ k said , &quot; there &apos;s no other free rooms on your floor ton@@ ight , so if you want to put the kids five flo@@ ors below you , there &apos;s a room there . &quot;
and the whole room filled with smo@@ ke in about two seconds .
and i remember , nat@@ as@@ ha didn &apos;t want us opening the door -- sorry , i was trying not to open the door , because we &apos;d spent so much time barri@@ c@@ ading the room .
this is a tri@@ -@@ star , and so they let nat@@ as@@ ha actually sit in the jump seat .
gene even did a little ti@@ le work in the kitchen , which was that , &quot; once upon a time , there was a beautiful girl that came from h@@ ills of korea to live happ@@ ily ever after in atlan@@ ta . &quot;
thank you all of you .
a lot has happened in the last few years , and let &apos;s start with the planets .
in fact , even back during the an@@ ci@@ ents , the solar system in that sense would look on a diagra@@ m like this .
most of these are can@@ di@@ dat@@ es .
so the question is : is that chemical phenomenon universal , or is it something which depends on the planet ?
this understanding of chemistry actually can help us with our daily lives .
can you imagine how small it is ?
let &apos;s start this new revolution at the tail end of the old one , with syn@@ thetic biology being the way to transform both our environment and our future .
then , uganda started to turn back , whereas z@@ im@@ bab@@ we sky@@ rock@@ et@@ ed , and some years later south africa had a terrible rise of hiv frequ@@ ency .
not the drug in itself , but the treatment and the care which is needed around it .
there &apos;s a lot of things that we thought , that now , good research , done by african institutions and researchers together with the international researchers , show that that &apos;s not the case .
un@@ aids have done good data available , finally , about the spread of hiv .
h@@ ans ro@@ s@@ ling un@@ v@@ ei@@ ls new data visu@@ als that un@@ tan@@ gle the complex risk factors of one of the world &apos;s de@@ ad@@ li@@ est diseases : hiv . he argu@@ es that pre@@ vent@@ ing trans@@ mis@@ sions -- not drug treat@@ ments -- is the key to en@@ ding the epidemic .
it &apos;s based on pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing power par@@ ity .
we know that &apos;s wrong , because we condu@@ cted two great natural experiments in the 20th century to see if geogra@@ ph@@ y ma@@ tter@@ ed more than institutions .
let &apos;s call them the kil@@ ler app@@ s .
mean@@ while , there &apos;s no scientific revolution anywhere else .
that &apos;s the consumer society , and it prop@@ els economic growth more than even technologi@@ cal change itself .
any society can adop@@ t these institutions , and when they do , they achieve what the west achie@@ ved after 1@@ 500 -- only faster .
that &apos;s so true .
and that &apos;s all we seem to be car@@ ing about recently .
so what this figure shows is that spi@@ ders date back to almost 3@@ 80 million years .
these can be grou@@ ped into seven categ@@ ories .
so i &apos;ve col@@ ored in the gl@@ y@@ cin@@ es again in green , al@@ an@@ ine in red , and the ser@@ ines , the letter s , in pur@@ ple . and you can see that the top repe@@ at unit can be expla@@ ined almost entirely by green and red , and the bottom repe@@ at unit has a substan@@ tial amount of pur@@ ple .
what you see here on this tou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess graph is the higher the black do@@ t is on the graph , the higher the tou@@ g@@ hn@@ ess .
to bor@@ row from the wri@@ t@@ ings of a spi@@ der named char@@ lot@@ te , silk is terri@@ fic .
fli@@ ck@@ r is a phot@@ o-@@ sharing service that allows people to take photos , u@@ plo@@ ad them , share them over the web and so forth .
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo .
and worst of all , that figure at the bottom , appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tely ten photos per photograph@@ er , is a lie .
this is the math under@@ lying the 80 / 20 rule . right ?
right ? so , when institutions are told they are ob@@ stac@@ les , and that there are other ways of co@@ ordin@@ ating the value , they go through something a little bit like the ku@@ bl@@ er-@@ ross st@@ ages -- -- of reaction , being told you have a f@@ at@@ al illness : den@@ ial , an@@ ger , bar@@ ga@@ ining , accep@@ tan@@ ce .
the inv@@ ent@@ ors don &apos;t know what the invention is .
there are people in the states right now t@@ ying themselves into kn@@ ots , trying to figure out whether or not blog@@ gers are journ@@ alists .
it was produced by analy@@ zing their communic@@ ations patterns using a lot of these tools . and dou@@ b@@ t@@ less the intelligence communities of the world are doing the same work today for the attac@@ ks of last week .
so a bak@@ er , and a good bak@@ er , knows how to pull or draw forth the in@@ her@@ ent sugar tra@@ pped in the star@@ ch .
that &apos;s the challenge . okay , so , now , what we -- in the journey of whe@@ at , let &apos;s go back and look at these 12 st@@ ages .
this takes a second , but it &apos;s a distin@@ ctive stage .
and then we have stage 12 , which the text@@ books call &quot; pac@@ k@@ aging , &quot; but my students call &quot; eating . &quot;
it &apos;s not only been killed , but it &apos;s been den@@ i@@ ed any potential for creating future life .
bacteria is in there , eating the same sug@@ ars , turning them into ac@@ ids .
it &apos;s used as a symbol for transformation .
and i &apos;m not kid@@ ding , i just think we should just say that and move forward .
they &apos;re all moun@@ ted on my instruments .
it &apos;s a bunch of crazy pic@@ to@@ graphic not@@ ation .
let &apos;s watch just another clip .
i &apos;ve decided , ultimately , that this is the wrong question , that this is not the important question .
so half the time , she ac@@ ted as if she liked the cra@@ ck@@ ers and didn &apos;t like the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i -- just like a baby and any other san@@ e person .
if we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us pri@@ mates , but also including other ma@@ mm@@ als , birds , even mar@@ su@@ pi@@ als like kan@@ g@@ aro@@ os and wom@@ bat@@ s , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexi@@ ble they are .
and at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still po@@ pping those wor@@ ms into those little open mou@@ ths .
then they test that new hypo@@ thesis and so on and so forth .
the first one is , again , remember , these are four year-@@ ol@@ ds .
oh .
and we even know something about the way the brain does this .
al@@ ison g@@ op@@ nik : what do babies think ?
now , the only way to get around that is to actually simu@@ late the human body and to simu@@ late that bit of the nervous system of the brain that contro@@ ls that body .
those are then sel@@ ec@@ ted by the algorith@@ m , re@@ produced with mu@@ tation and re@@ combin@@ ations to introduce sex as well .
now , this might look kind of tri@@ vi@@ al , but it &apos;s actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any inter@@ active or any virtual worl@@ ds .
and then , finally hits the floor .
so , they wanted to have a digital version of a stun@@ t@@ man and that &apos;s what we &apos;ve been working on for the past few months .
at the moment , doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days .
there &apos;s so many things we can do with this right now .
we do have one un@@ inten@@ tional dan@@ cer actually , the last thing i &apos;m going to show you .
it &apos;s a children &apos;s book for the i@@ pad .
i remember we cri@@ ed prof@@ us@@ ely when the little go@@ ats we played with in the summer became bi@@ ri@@ an@@ i .
and my argument &#91; is &#93; that the only way for us to teach creativity is by teaching children perspe@@ c@@ tives at the earli@@ est stage .
and you &apos;ll get paid for it . you can think about it , if you want .
which they do .
let &apos;s create a word process@@ or that &apos;s just a word process@@ or .
there are these &quot; wi@@ z@@ ards &quot; everywhere .
pal@@ m is also , especially in the old days , wonderful about this .
i write the code that f@@ its the world today .
i made a fortun@@ e over at pi@@ x@@ ar .
in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recogni@@ tion software , and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous .
dp : thank you very much .
and the dan@@ ger is that they can cause roughly what &apos;s a pan@@ de@@ mic .
and i would say that we can &apos;t give up the rule of law to fight an as@@ y@@ m@@ me@@ tri@@ c threat , which is what we seem to be doing because of the present , the people that are in power , because that &apos;s to give up the thing that makes civilization .
we &apos;ll hear a lot more about that from al gore very shor@@ tly .
it &apos;s a strange place inside a nan@@ ot@@ u@@ be .
we need new anti-@@ vir@@ als and cock@@ ta@@ ils . we need new kinds of vac@@ cin@@ es .
and finally , i think we have to do something that &apos;s not really -- it &apos;s almost un@@ accep@@ table to say this -- which , we have to begin to design the future .
i think it &apos;s time that we transi@@ tioned to a solar syste@@ m-@@ going civilization and species .
how hard is it going to be to find life on mars ?
i think it &apos;s there , and i think we need to go look for it , and i think it &apos;s under@@ ground .
it &apos;s a very simple trick , and i never fail to do it when i &apos;m sitting in a window seat .
in this ca@@ ve , great areas are covered by this red@@ dis@@ h material that you see here , and also these enormous cr@@ y@@ st@@ als of sel@@ en@@ ite that you can see dan@@ gling down .
in order to access these sub-@@ surface environments that we &apos;re interested in , we &apos;re very interested in developing the tools to do this .
so , we &apos;re talking about things like in@@ fl@@ at@@ able lin@@ ers that can con@@ form to the complex to@@ po@@ logi@@ cal shape on the inside of a ca@@ ve , fo@@ am@@ e@@ d-@@ in-@@ place air@@ lo@@ cks to deal with this complex to@@ po@@ log@@ y , various ways of getting brea@@ thing g@@ ases made from the in@@ trin@@ si@@ c materials of these bodies .
but when you tell someone your goal and they ac@@ knowledge it , psych@@ ologists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot;
and so it is with archi@@ me@@ des , the great gre@@ ek mathemati@@ cian .
for@@ ger@@ ies were pain@@ ted over it , and it suff@@ ered very b@@ ad@@ ly from m@@ old .
and so before we could start ima@@ ging archi@@ me@@ des , we had to take this book apart .
and that &apos;s what it looks like .
but as the electr@@ ons go round at the speed of light , they shed x-@@ ra@@ ys .
this was a bad idea , because phili@@ p of ma@@ ce@@ don had a son called alex@@ ander the great , and they lost the battle of cha@@ er@@ one@@ a .
because institutions at the moment con@@ fine their data with copy@@ right re@@ stri@@ ctions and that sort of thing .
how do you read a two-@@ thou@@ sand@@ -year-old man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt that has been er@@ ased , cut up , written on and pain@@ ted over ? with a powerful partic@@ le acceler@@ ator , of course ! ancient books cur@@ ator willi@@ am no@@ el tells the fascinating story behind the archi@@ me@@ des pal@@ imp@@ s@@ est , a by@@ z@@ ant@@ ine pra@@ yer book con@@ ta@@ ining previ@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ un@@ known original wri@@ t@@ ings from ancient gre@@ ek mathemati@@ cian archi@@ me@@ des and others .
there are very few places in the u.s. where you can try real ko@@ be , and one of them is wol@@ f@@ gang pu@@ ck &apos;s restaurant , cut , in los angeles .
they did give me a tour , though .
i did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other o@@ live o@@ ils .
and to try this -- i couldn &apos;t get a lo@@ aner , but i did go into the manhattan sho@@ w@@ room of the manufac@@ tur@@ er , to@@ to , and they have a ba@@ th@@ room off of the sho@@ w@@ room that you can use , which i used .
most of the cars that i drive , if i get up to 80 they start to r@@ attle .
it was three days , four me@@ als .
and in particular , i think we can learn things about learning .
it &apos;s from the game world of war@@ craft with more than 10 million players glob@@ ally , one of whom is me , another of whom is my wife .
now , if you take a game like war@@ craft , you can think about it , if you like , as a great bo@@ x-@@ opening effort .
no , we want one or two mon@@ sters on the screen at any one time .
second , multiple long and shor@@ t-@@ term a@@ im@@ s -- 5,000 p@@ ies , bor@@ ing , 15 p@@ ies , interesting .
and what this means is we can predict learning , we can predict en@@ han@@ ced engagement , these windows , these windows of time , in which the learning is taking place at an en@@ han@@ ced level .
let &apos;s start with business .
and through this work , i hope to better understand the evolutionary vulner@@ abilities of our bodies , so that we can improve and better manage our health in the future .
and so previous studies had only focused on micro@@ scop@@ y .
so i took a job at the united nations world food programme as a way to try to address these security issues through food security issues .
unfortunately , o@@ bes@@ ity &apos;s not only an american problem .
there &apos;s this large , con@@ soli@@ d@@ ated far@@ ming that &apos;s led to what we eat in america , and it &apos;s really been since around 19@@ 80 , after the oil crisis , when , you know , mass con@@ soli@@ dation , mass ex@@ o@@ du@@ s of small farmers in this country .
the i@@ con@@ s like michael po@@ ll@@ an and jam@@ ie oli@@ ver in his ted prize wish both add@@ ressed this last three-@@ decade time period as incredibly relevant for food system change .
this is a construction hel@@ met that i received two years ago at the gro@@ und@@ breaking of the largest project i , and my fir@@ m , have ever been involved in .
but i &apos;m going to reduce this to the beginning of the process , into three very pe@@ dan@@ tic stat@@ ements .
if we are so good at our craft shouldn &apos;t we be able to conc@@ ei@@ ve of an architec@@ tural mani@@ fest@@ ation that sli@@ des se@@ am@@ less@@ ly through the project &apos;s and the cli@@ ent &apos;s con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts ?
the architec@@ tural mani@@ fest@@ ation was frank@@ ly just du@@ m@@ b .
you &apos;re going down into our lo@@ bby , go through the lo@@ bby with our own little dan@@ g@@ ly bits , whether you like them or not , up through the sta@@ ir that leads you into the audi@@ tor@@ ium .
and the solution in terms of the bal@@ con@@ ies was to use something that we all know as a sc@@ ore@@ board li@@ ft .
this building has the ability , in short order , to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can r@@ ent it out .
and to re@@ mind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something .
and i really loved this idea of the par@@ tial gli@@ mp@@ se into somebody &apos;s life .
&quot; i love how they were able to preser@@ ve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- bu@@ tter@@ flies , man@@ -@@ made forests , li@@ me@@ stone ca@@ ves and hey , even a huge py@@ th@@ on . &quot;
so these are some ne@@ wer projects that actually aren &apos;t even launched publi@@ c@@ ly yet .
we &apos;re very used to this .
this graph that i &apos;m cli@@ cking down here is meant to be re@@ min@@ is@@ cent of a medical hear@@ t@@ beat graph , showing the exciting moments of ad@@ ren@@ al@@ ine .
so , you have some really happy person holding 10 ballo@@ ons , and some really sad sou@@ l holding one ballo@@ on .
he had this amazing series of ha@@ irs growing out of a mo@@ le on the left side of his face , which i &apos;m told is very good lu@@ ck .
one of the more tou@@ ch@@ y political subje@@ cts in b@@ hu@@ tan is the use of indian cheap labor that they im@@ port from india to build the roads , and then they send these people home once the roads are built .
but i pre@@ fer for maybe 40 to 50 .
and you never think you &apos;re going to be the guy who &apos;s walking down the street and , because you choose to go down one side or the other , the rest of your life is changed forever .
and — — the nur@@ se kind of had a hy@@ ster@@ ical lau@@ gh , and i &apos;m turning my head trying to see everybody , and i had this weird memory of being in college and raising , raising money for the flo@@ od vic@@ ti@@ ms of banglades@@ h , and then i look over and my an@@ es@@ thes@@ i@@ ologist is cl@@ am@@ ping the mas@@ k on me , and i think , &quot; he looks banglades@@ hi , &quot; — — and i just have those two facts , and i just think , &quot; this could work somehow . &quot;
ed ga@@ vag@@ an : a story about kn@@ ots and surge@@ ons
now of course , as history has gone by , it &apos;s been natural for there to be a certain amount of ble@@ ed between speech and writing .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing in this fing@@ ered speech .
if you listen to the way black you@@ th today speak , think about the use of the word &quot; yo . &quot;
&quot; many do not know the al@@ phab@@ et or multi@@ plic@@ ation table , cannot write gra@@ m@@ matically -- &quot; we &apos;ve heard that sort of thing before , not just in 195@@ 6 . 19@@ 17 , connec@@ tic@@ ut scho@@ ol@@ teacher .
and then the third thing would be , please show me a s@@ hea@@ f of tex@@ ts written by 16@@ -year-old girls , because i would want to know where this language had developed since our times , and ide@@ ally i would then send them back to you and me now so we could exam@@ ine this l@@ ingu@@ i@@ stic mira@@ cle happening right under our no@@ ses .
gol@@ an le@@ v@@ in : software art
it is extremely un@@ likely the taliban would ever be able to take over the country -- extremely un@@ likely they &apos;d be able to sei@@ ze kab@@ u@@ l .
and the same is true for the tro@@ ops .
and yet , nobody listen@@ ed to them .
very , very sa@@ dly , our foreign services , the united nations , the military in these countries have very little idea of what &apos;s going on .
but you need to look at context .
it makes failure invisible , in@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable and ine@@ vi@@ table .
the problem that i want to talk with you about is really the problem of : how does one supply health@@ care in a world in which cost is everything ?
that &apos;s what a hydro@@ phili@@ c surface does .
those half of you , roughly , who are women , at some point may have had a preg@@ nan@@ cy test .
there is a very important issue here , which is that because it &apos;s a prin@@ ter , a color prin@@ ter , it prin@@ ts colors . that &apos;s what color pr@@ inter@@ s do .
so , you take the drop of blood , no further manipu@@ lations , you put it on a little device , the device fil@@ ters out the blood cells , lets the ser@@ um go through , and you get a series of colors down in the bottom there .
and , of course the answer is , &quot; you don &apos;t . &quot;
and we sent it off , and by return mail it came back .
traditional lab tests for disease diagno@@ sis can be too expensive and cum@@ ber@@ some for the regi@@ ons most in need . george whit@@ es@@ i@@ des &apos; in@@ geni@@ ous answer is a fo@@ ol@@ pro@@ of tool that can be manu@@ f@@ actu@@ red at virtu@@ ally zero cost . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named bar@@ ack obama .
and so we can look at a bunch of different vari@@ ables .
but you see demo@@ cr@@ ats versus republi@@ can , not a big difference based on who your neighb@@ ors are .
and you interact a lot with your neighb@@ ors -- people you like , people you might not know .
i &apos;m a physi@@ cian practic@@ ing with cu@@ tt@@ ing-@@ edge technology .
he says , &quot; you see , when she said , &apos; good morning , &apos; i picked up her fi@@ fe ac@@ cent .
so within a few years , in the late 18@@ 00@@ s , early 19@@ 00@@ s , all of a sudden , the bar@@ ber surge@@ on had given way to the physi@@ cian who was trying to make a diagno@@ sis .
there &apos;s a real dis@@ jun@@ ction between the patient &apos;s perception and our own per@@ cep@@ tions as physi@@ cians of the best medical care .
and to her , that spoke of a kind of atten@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess that she needed .
the good news , it &apos;s not cancer , it &apos;s not tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ los@@ is , it &apos;s not co@@ c@@ ci@@ dio@@ i@@ dom@@ y@@ co@@ sis or some ob@@ sc@@ ure f@@ ung@@ al infe@@ ction .
i would per@@ c@@ uss the ch@@ est . i would listen to the heart .
modern medicine is in dan@@ ger of losing a powerful , ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned tool : human touch . physi@@ cian and writer abra@@ ham ver@@ gh@@ ese descri@@ bes our strange new world where patients are mer@@ ely data points , and calls for a return to the traditional one-@@ on-@@ one physical ex@@ am .
and the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
and in all cases we have to ask -- what &apos;s the more likely explanation ?
in the case of g@@ ali@@ le@@ o , he had two problems when he turned his telescop@@ e to saturn .
faces of all kinds are easy to see .
i guess you can only have one mira@@ cle per building .
it was in the top five in 2005 , called , &quot; nine million bi@@ cy@@ cles in bei@@ j@@ ing . &quot;
heart and blood ves@@ sel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combin@@ ed , and yet it &apos;s completely pre@@ vent@@ able for almost everybody .
imagine : many of these problems could be pre@@ v@@ ented if these babies were just kept warm .
over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies .
but what do we do for a living ?
and then he went to north car@@ ol@@ ina and did it again .
and you can build an entire industry on that .
and people in white hat@@ s sa@@ iling bo@@ ats .
so some people will go out and get people to be on one team .
someone stands up and says , &quot; this one is important .
&quot; what would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes i gave exactly the same pair to someone who doesn &apos;t even own a pair of shoes ? &quot;
being a leader gives you char@@ is@@ ma .
the sen@@ sor would have to be in@@ expensive , ra@@ pid , simple , sensitive , sel@@ ec@@ tive , and minim@@ ally invasi@@ ve .
you start with some water , po@@ ur in some nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , add anti@@ bodies , mix it up , take some paper , di@@ p it , dry it , and you can dete@@ ct cancer .
and so in the next two to five years , this sen@@ sor could poten@@ tially li@@ ft for pan@@ crea@@ tic cancer survival rates from a dis@@ mal 5@@ .@@ 5 percent to close to 100 percent , and it would do similar for o@@ vari@@ an and lung cancer .
my experience , however , in the islam@@ ic world is very different .
so , for example , there is the character of no@@ or@@ a .
and why does sex make babies , and babies sp@@ ell ero@@ tic disaster in cou@@ ples ?
what is the relationship between love and desire ?
and in this space between me and the other lies the ero@@ tic é@@ lan , lies that movement toward the other .
is it a place where you can express your in@@ fan@@ ti@@ le wi@@ sh@@ es ?
it won &apos;t make a dent . there is nobody at the re@@ ception des@@ k .
child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoul@@ der all the time .
it &apos;s focus and pres@@ ence .
we managed , but sometimes those hall@@ s didn &apos;t seem exactly su@@ ited to the music i was making or had made .
they &apos;re smaller , even less rever@@ ber@@ ant , so he can write really fri@@ l@@ ly music that &apos;s very intri@@ c@@ ate -- and it works .
it meant that there could be extreme dynam@@ ics , which there weren &apos;t in some of these other kinds of music .
other sing@@ ers after him went even further .
and in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly .
and i thought : well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , pri@@ mar@@ ily the form at least , to fit these con@@ tex@@ ts , and if we make art to fit g@@ aller@@ y walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit exi@@ sting operating systems , is that how it works ?
and had such -- it was an e@@ ye@@ -@@ opening experience to hear them talk about the world that is yet to come through technology and science .
but this is not the first time that we &apos;ve had a technologi@@ cal revolution .
and yet he says , &quot; he re@@ stor@@ es my sou@@ l . &quot;
you &apos;ve seen people take bene@@ ficial technologi@@ cal advan@@ ces , such as the internet we &apos;ve heard about ton@@ ight , and twi@@ st them into something cor@@ rup@@ ting .
and i &apos;d been to russi@@ a several times under the comm@@ uni@@ sts , and they &apos;d given me mar@@ vel@@ ous freedom that i didn &apos;t expect .
we have families that self-@@ destru@@ ct , friends that betra@@ y us .
and it &apos;s often difficult for young people to understand that .
the reality of this life and his res@@ ur@@ rec@@ tion is the hope of man@@ kind . &quot;
equ@@ ally well known is pas@@ cal &apos;s wa@@ ger .
i couldn &apos;t prove it .
everyone can be wrong .
you don &apos;t need to say her name out l@@ oud , you can just hold her .

two months later , i go to another village on the same as@@ sign@@ ment and they asked me to live with the village ch@@ ie@@ f .
she &apos;s 19 ; her dream is to go to college to be able to support them .
when these girls sit , you un@@ lock intelligence , you un@@ lock passion , you un@@ lock commit@@ ment , you un@@ lock focus , you un@@ lock great leaders .
these were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman -- i failed , i failed , i failed .
i &apos;m looking for ways for other girls to be with me .
le@@ y@@ ma@@ h , thank you . thank you so much for coming to ted .
we require high-@@ end talent management to keep the rock band together and playing .
or take another example : big data .
they found a tre@@ as@@ ure tro@@ ve of docum@@ ents : 700 bi@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cal sk@@ et@@ ches of foreign figh@@ ters .
there was data online from a 2006 environmental risk conference , other ge@@ o@@ spa@@ tial data , none of it integr@@ ated .
now the first step in solving any problem is ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the reality of the situation you &apos;re in .
do three hours &apos; work .
so i jo@@ ined a gy@@ m . &quot;
because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s definition of success away from the mor@@ on@@ ically simpli@@ stic notion that the person with the most money when he dies w@@ ins , to a more thou@@ ght@@ ful and bal@@ an@@ ced definition of what a life well lived looks like .
unfortunately , race and class are extremely reli@@ able indi@@ cat@@ ors as to where one might find the good stuff , like par@@ ks and trees , and where one might find the bad stuff , like power plants and waste facili@@ ties .
but the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community , and i am in between these two worl@@ ds , with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other .
what costs are associated with these decisions ? and who pa@@ ys ?
both can be used instead of pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um@@ -@@ based roo@@ fing materials that absor@@ b heat , contribu@@ te to urban &quot; heat island &quot; effect and de@@ grade under the sun , which we in turn brea@@ the . green roo@@ fs also re@@ tain up to 75 percent of rain@@ fall , so they reduce a city &apos;s need to fund co@@ stly en@@ d-@@ of-@@ pi@@ pe solutions -- which , inci@@ dent@@ ally , are often loc@@ ated in environmental justice communities like mine .
at present , that &apos;s not happening in new york city .
his admini@@ stration nar@@ ro@@ wed key m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ al th@@ or@@ ough@@ far@@ es from five lan@@ es to three , out@@ la@@ wed par@@ king on those streets , exp@@ and@@ ed pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an wal@@ k@@ ways and bi@@ ke lan@@ es , created public pla@@ z@@ as , created one of the most efficient bus mas@@ s-@@ trans@@ it systems in the entire world .
but gras@@ s@@ roots groups are needed at the table during the decisi@@ on-@@ making process .
and actually , she re@@ ac@@ ted exactly the way that i hop@@ ed that she would .
you look online , you &apos;ll see places like co@@ deca@@ de@@ my and events like co@@ der@@ do@@ jo and sites like girls who code , or black girls code .
it uses the web@@ c@@ am .
so this was a game where the big fish e@@ ats the little fish , but he wanted to keep sc@@ ore , so that each time the big fish e@@ ats the little fish , the sc@@ ore would go up and it would keep track , and he didn &apos;t know how to do that .
re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of whether he gro@@ ws up to be a marketing man@@ ager or a mechan@@ ic or a community organi@@ zer , that these ideas are useful for everybody .
now at this point you &apos;re going to see a picture of mi@@ ch@@ el@@ angel@@ o .
ok , it &apos;s not marketing ; there &apos;s a very interesting car concept here , but the marketing part is not what i want to talk about here .
because what we &apos;re interested in is finding form that &apos;s more than just a function .
and because these are artists , they have very arti@@ stic temper@@ am@@ ents .
they would come together , compare notes . then they would work apart , come together , and they would produce together a mon@@ um@@ ent@@ al set of diver@@ se opini@@ ons that didn &apos;t po@@ ll@@ ute each other &apos;s ideas -- but at the same time came together and resol@@ ved the problems .
so we went to ti@@ bur@@ on , after three months , and the team had gotten together the week before , many days ahead of time .
probably because they had all the fun and i didn &apos;t , you know .
thanks so much .
but what it means is that we fail to identify a gre@@ asy po@@ cket in these proteins , into which we , like molecular lo@@ ck@@ s@@ mi@@ ths , can fashion an active , small , organic molecule or drug sub@@ stance .
they were changing shape .
we basically tried to create the most competi@@ tive environment for our lab as possible .
i want to leave you with just two ideas .
which tells you something about our place in the universe .
and you have to imagine doing that squ@@ ee@@ zing without any im@@ perfe@@ ctions , without any little spo@@ ts where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else .
we &apos;d like to understand that .
in every little cu@@ bi@@ c centi@@ meter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself .
well what is the im@@ plic@@ ation of that ?
so bol@@ tz@@ mann says , we will only live in the part of the multi@@ verse , in the part of this infin@@ itely big set of flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ating particles , where life is possible .
it &apos;s cool@@ ing off .
this is a br@@ ute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
i had never used a computer .
it was the future i couldn &apos;t accept .
so i would like to say something to all the people out there like me to the afri@@ cans , and the poor who are strug@@ gling with your dreams .
what i got is basically a gest@@ ure interface device that actually acts as a mo@@ tion@@ -@@ sen@@ sing device made for two dollars .
so , in order to realize this dream , i actually thought of putting a big@@ -@@ size proje@@ ctor on my head .
here , i &apos;m di@@ aling a phone number just using my hand .
when i come back to my des@@ k i can just pin@@ ch that information back to my des@@ k@@ top so i can use my ful@@ l-@@ size computer .
india ? how are you going to spli@@ t your time going forward ?
ep : okay , that &apos;s very tou@@ ching , very emotional , but it was not easy to get there .
so every time you see a con@@ cre@@ te jung@@ le like that , what you &apos;ve got to do is find open spaces .
you don &apos;t have to dig deep down under@@ ground .
so i want to make two points here ton@@ ight about fa@@ vel@@ as .
we fight f@@ loo@@ ds , tro@@ pic@@ al ra@@ ins at this time of the year .
nothing of conc@@ ern in terms of traffic .
if there &apos;s 3.@@ 5 billion now , it &apos;s going to be six billion then it &apos;s going to be 10 billion .
per@@ u@@ vi@@ ans love japanese wo@@ od@@ block prin@@ ts .
it &apos;s women who actually push history forward .
but arti@@ stic and de@@ cor@@ ative skills are actually much older than that .
by the end of the hand ax@@ e epi@@ c , homo sa@@ pi@@ ens -- as they were then called , finally -- were dou@@ b@@ t@@ less finding new ways to am@@ use and ama@@ ze each other by , who knows , telling jo@@ kes , stor@@ y@@ telling , dan@@ cing , or ha@@ ir@@ sty@@ ling .
we decided to give it a try , because we thought , &quot; hey , how hard could it be ? &quot;
one is , first of all , process this information to have an understanding of the environment -- these are the lan@@ es of the road , there &apos;s the ob@@ stac@@ les -- and con@@ vey this information to the driver .
actually , you can also change the frequ@@ ency of the air coming out and possibly the temperature .
but sometimes -- but sometimes i also do get -- i wouldn &apos;t call it hate mail -- but letters of really strong conc@@ ern : &quot; dr . h@@ ong , are you in@@ san@@ e , trying to put blind people on the road ?
this fan@@ t@@ asy of inv@@ ul@@ ner@@ ability was so complete that i even dec@@ ei@@ ved myself , and as the first se@@ me@@ ster ended and the second began , there was no way that anyone could have predi@@ cted what was just about to happen .
now it &apos;s down on my medical recor@@ ds that ele@@ an@@ or has del@@ u@@ sions that she &apos;s a television news broad@@ ca@@ ster .
but together , they for@@ ged a bl@@ end of coura@@ ge , creativity , integri@@ ty , and an uns@@ ha@@ ke@@ able belief that my sh@@ at@@ ter@@ ed self could become heal@@ ed and whole .
this type of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
and about a quar@@ ter of all the people in prin@@ c@@ et@@ on died that winter from hunger and cold , but nobody remem@@ bers that .
so , we believe that on europa there is , in fact , a deep ocean .
so they would have to have something like a re@@ p@@ tili@@ an skin .
you stra@@ p it onto your fore@@ head , so you can see the refle@@ ction in the eyes of the animal . so , if you go out at night , you sh@@ ine a flas@@ h@@ light , the animals are bright .
i call these creatures sun@@ flo@@ wers .
and then there was another influence .
this is a watch we made for min@@ i co@@ op@@ er , the car company , right when it launched , and it &apos;s the first watch that has a display that swi@@ t@@ ches from horizon@@ tal to ver@@ tical .
but the other thing that is human@@ i@@ stic about ja@@ w@@ bone is that we really decided to take out all the tech@@ ie stuff , and all the ner@@ dy stuff out of it , and try to make it as beautiful as we can .
and then while we were doing this , the shape of the bot@@ tle up@@ side down re@@ min@@ ded us of a y , and then we thought , well these words , &quot; why &quot; and &quot; why not , &quot; are probably the most important words that kids ask .
i mean it &apos;s col@@ or@@ ful , it &apos;s fun .
so , i have more , you can always ask me for some more later .
now , we &apos;ll per@@ form &quot; clou@@ d@@ bur@@ st &quot; for you .
are we gu@@ il@@ ty , as ch@@ ima@@ m@@ anda adi@@ ch@@ ie re@@ min@@ ded us at the ted conference in oxford , of as@@ sum@@ ing that there is a single story of women &apos;s strug@@ gles for their rights while there are , in fact , many ?
and men are affected by those rules too .
i told him , &apos; i &apos;m a belie@@ ver , and women and children in these terrible conditions need their faith to survive . &apos; &quot; she s@@ miles sl@@ y@@ ly .
so les@@ b@@ or , we bl@@ end the two .
this small group of women , determin@@ ed to bring an end to the war , and they cho@@ se to use their tradi@@ tions to make a point : li@@ beri@@ an women usually wear lots of je@@ wel@@ ry and col@@ or@@ ful clo@@ thing .
when she made her pres@@ identi@@ al address , she ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged these bra@@ ve women of liber@@ ia who allowed her to win against a foot@@ ball star -- that &apos;s soc@@ cer for you americans -- no less .
we can use our tradition to navi@@ gate change .
and a man just star@@ ed at me , and he was like , &quot; well , why don &apos;t you use the internet ? &quot;
and so you can make your molecule in the prin@@ ter using this software .
they were together while doing the ta@@ wa@@ f , the cir@@ cular walk around the ka@@ ab@@ a .
and these were tradi@@ tions of the middle east -- medi@@ ev@@ al tradi@@ tions .
for example , in sau@@ di arab@@ ia there is a phenomenon called the religious police .
which means that musli@@ ms can , today , look at those things and say , &quot; well , the core of our religion is here to stay with us .
but there is a curious question : if islam@@ ic moder@@ nis@@ m was so popular in the 19@@ th and early 20th cent@@ u@@ ries , why did islam@@ ism become so popular in the rest of the 20th century ?
and they realize that democracy is something that is com@@ pati@@ ble with islam , com@@ pati@@ ble with their values , and they &apos;ve been suppor@@ tive of democracy .
thanks so much .
instead of sta@@ ining all of the cells inside of a tissue , it somehow only sta@@ ins about one percent of them .
and in order to understand how ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in works , it &apos;s critical to understand where the ser@@ on@@ ton@@ in machin@@ ery is .
in the middle east , conflict between isra@@ eli@@ s and pal@@ est@@ ini@@ ans continu@@ es un@@ ab@@ ated , and it becomes ever more difficult to see how , just how a possible , sustainable solution can be achie@@ ved .
to put it differently , for the civili@@ ans that suff@@ er the consequences of eth@@ ni@@ c conflict and civil war , there is no good war and there is no bad peace .
who ever could have imag@@ ined ian pa@@ is@@ ley and martin mc@@ gu@@ inn@@ ess jo@@ in@@ tly gover@@ ning northern ir@@ eland as first and de@@ pu@@ ty first minister ?
so what then dist@@ ingu@@ ish@@ es the isra@@ el@@ i / pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an conflict from that in northern ir@@ eland , or the civil war in sud@@ an from that in liber@@ ia ?
nature &apos;s my mus@@ e and it &apos;s been my passion .
and where that energy tou@@ ches water , something new emer@@ ges : life .
life fl@@ our@@ ished in s@@ w@@ am@@ ps .
ki@@ wi@@ s are , and so are these ha@@ w@@ ks tra@@ pped near ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a .
and it has alter@@ ed the earth . it co@@ vers earth like a skin .
so then there was a lot more be@@ ers , and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mu@@ sta@@ che back .
so my lesson that year was per@@ si@@ st@@ ence .
but he said , &quot; we will partner with you , but we &apos;re not going to invest in it . you need to figure a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work . &quot;
we &apos;d had a great campaign , and to be honest , we &apos;d had our fair share of be@@ er that night , but i said , &quot; you know what , i think we &apos;ve got one more bar left in us . &quot;
we literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions and researchers around the world , and when we looked at this more recently , we realized there &apos;s a real lack of collaboration going on even within institutions , let alone nation@@ ally , let alone glob@@ ally , and this is not unique to pro@@ state cancer . this is cancer research the world over .
ben@@ ki knew this .
why are you making yourself vulnerable to what is often a ho@@ sti@@ le world ? &quot;
things are bad enough as they are . &quot;
they have res@@ pite homes , the first , the first care centers , the first coun@@ sel@@ ing services -- and not just in urban , 7@@ -@@ milli@@ on-@@ population bang@@ al@@ ore , but in the har@@ dest to reach villa@@ ges in the state of kar@@ nat@@ ak@@ a .
but if you sat down and asked him , &quot; who are you really , and what do you do ? &quot;
they &apos;ve built bri@@ d@@ ges , and they &apos;ve walked across them .
k@@ arti@@ ke@@ ya le@@ ap@@ t on his pe@@ ac@@ o@@ ck and fle@@ w around the contin@@ ents and the mountains and the oceans .
it took place , once , in 3@@ 26 b@@ .@@ c .
&quot; what should you not be ?
when kr@@ is@@ hn@@ a dies , eventually he will be back as ra@@ m .
so , the value of his life was the sum total of his achie@@ v@@ ements .
you see , indian music , for example , does not have the concept of harmon@@ y .
i even was a business consu@@ l@@ t@@ ant , doing strategi@@ es and tac@@ tics .
hin@@ du@@ s don &apos;t have the concept of comm@@ and@@ ments .
they are cultural cre@@ ations , not natural phenomen@@ a .
you &apos;re too la@@ zy to do it . it &apos;s too hard .
but you &apos;ve managed to talk yourself into that .
what you want , what you want , what you want , is passion . it is beyond interest .
i want to be a great par@@ ent , and i will not sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce them on the alt@@ ar of great ac@@ compli@@ sh@@ ment . &quot;
you know what you &apos;re going to say ?
but you &apos;re afraid .
so i studied her mammo@@ gra@@ m , and i re@@ vie@@ wed the radi@@ ology liter@@ ature , and i was sho@@ cked to discover that , in her case , our chan@@ ces of finding a tumor early on the mammo@@ gra@@ m were less than the to@@ ss of a co@@ in .
both tumor@@ s and den@@ se breast tissue appear white on a mammo@@ gra@@ m , and the x-@@ ray often can &apos;t dist@@ ingu@@ ish between the two .
one m@@ ri scan costs 10 times what a digital mammo@@ gra@@ m costs .
but using our new dete@@ ctor , we could begin to see the out@@ line of a tumor .
m@@ bi found 8@@ 3 percent .
our man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt was then accep@@ ted and will be published later this month in the journ@@ al radi@@ ology .
but for women with den@@ se brea@@ sts ; we shouldn &apos;t ab@@ and@@ on scre@@ ening al@@ together , we need to offer them something better .
what can we do with that guy &apos;s data ?
so we can protect ourselves if he was up to no good ?
we know more about mobile operating systems , but what we really need is a moral operating system .
he says something &apos;s just . she says something else is just .
he wants obje@@ ctive tru@@ ths .
suppose i go up and i say , &quot; i &apos;m going to take your phone . &quot;
what &apos;s the for@@ mul@@ a that we can use in any situation to deter@@ mine what we should do , whether we should use that guy &apos;s data or not ?
&quot; did i ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate what would be the highest pleasure like mil@@ l would ?
and you &apos;re telling him what we &apos;re talking about , about our whole data revolution and all this -- maybe even h@@ um a few b@@ ars of our theme music .
it &apos;s you . it &apos;s me .
and this noise is like a &quot; sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , &quot; like that .
and turning around you is &quot; sh@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , &quot; like that .
anyway , this project , or this experience , make me start a new project on the design of medicine .
this one is a &quot; third lung , &quot; a pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical device for long-term as@@ th@@ ma treatment .
it would be a great honor , a great compli@@ ment for me , if he hadn &apos;t decided to take all them off two hours before the opening .
but the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants .
so now we can brea@@ the sa@@ f@@ ely .
it &apos;s a lot easier to be ligh@@ the@@ ar@@ ted about other people &apos;s trage@@ dy than your own , and i want to keep it in the spirit of the conference .
then along comes cra@@ ck co@@ ca@@ ine .
de@@ fied all kinds of boundar@@ ies : was he black or white ? was he man or woman ?
and you and i , probably , fac@@ ed with the situation , would think , well , i guess i &apos;m going to write my dis@@ ser@@ tation on the gr@@ ate@@ ful dead .
and they &apos;re the ones who basically make the profit or lose a profit , depen@@ ding on how good they are at running the business .
so , with sho@@ ot@@ ing at you , what are the death rates ?
just like , say , a law@@ yer at a law fir@@ m -- a fir@@ st-@@ year law@@ yer is wi@@ ling to start at the bottom , work 8@@ 0-@@ hour weeks for not that much money , because they think they &apos;re going to make partner .
because they &apos;re not willing to be at risk .
also different a@@ er@@ ob@@ a@@ tic man@@ eu@@ vers are possible with a par@@ ag@@ li@@ der .
two years after this , i was the first to base jump from ma@@ tter@@ hor@@ n , a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here .
u@@ el@@ i gegen@@ sch@@ atz : pretty much . i believe this is probably the clo@@ s@@ est possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly .
do people come to you with projects and say , &quot; we want you to do this ! &quot;
who is the consumer , if you want , and who has responsibility for what one sees ?
&quot; and does it matter whether the kind of actions i take filter into a sense of responsibility ? &quot;
a sort of a run track , or a walk track , on the top of a museum in den@@ mark , which is made of col@@ ored glass , going all around .
because i think it makes a difference whether you have a body that feels a part of a space , rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture .
ol@@ af@@ ur eli@@ as@@ son : playing with space and light
but most deep@@ -@@ di@@ ving ro@@ v@@ s these days use hy@@ dr@@ au@@ lic@@ s and they sound like the vent@@ ana .
yet we have spent only a tiny fra@@ ction of the money on ocean explor@@ ation that we &apos;ve spent on space explor@@ ation .
na@@ th@@ alia c@@ ran@@ e was a little girl from broo@@ kl@@ yn .
it is to explain death to a child , and it deser@@ ves a piece of pla@@ in-@@ song music . &quot;
nat@@ al@@ ie mer@@ ch@@ ant : sing@@ ing old po@@ em@@ s to life
and you can &apos;t get more alien than the dolph@@ in .
i &apos;m a farm boy . i grew up surro@@ unded by animals , and i would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there ?
and then i was stru@@ ck in the history of the internet .
well , my name is alli@@ son g@@ ins@@ bur@@ g , and we &apos;re live in bal@@ ti@@ more at the national a@@ qu@@ ari@@ um .
it has 3.@@ 4 times 10 to the 3@@ 8@@ th possible ter@@ min@@ ations .
so the inter@@ planet@@ ary system is on its way , but there &apos;s a last project , which the defen@@ se advanced research projects agen@@ cy , which fund@@ ed the original ar@@ pan@@ et , fund@@ ed the internet , fund@@ ed the inter@@ planet@@ ary architecture , is now fund@@ ing a project to design a spac@@ ec@@ raft to get to the ne@@ ar@@ est star in 100 years &apos; time .
wow . well done .
it &apos;s like , on facebook , you have friends only from -- it &apos;s like your neighb@@ ors are your friends on facebook .
the day after , ir@@ ani@@ ans started to respond with their own po@@ sters .
you have le@@ ban@@ on that just -- a few days ago .
i met with people that are supposed to be my ene@@ mi@@ es for the first time . and we just sha@@ ke hands , and have a coffee and a nice discussion , and we talk about food and bas@@ ket@@ ball .
just raise that . exactly .
his famous evolutionary tree could almost be a diagra@@ m of the way we work .
the swe@@ dis@@ h j@@ ury didn &apos;t think so either . so we lost .
you know , it &apos;s one of the biggest countries in the world , one of the small@@ est .
so we thought that these ex@@ po@@ s quite often have a lot of state finan@@ ced pro@@ pag@@ anda , images , stat@@ ements , but no real experience .
but to conclu@@ de , if you want to see the mer@@ ma@@ id from may to dec@@ ember next year , don &apos;t come to cop@@ enha@@ gen , because she &apos;s going to be in sh@@ ang@@ hai .
and since we always re@@ fer to the project as the mountain , we com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed this japanese hi@@ mal@@ a@@ ya photograph@@ er to give us this beautiful photo of mo@@ unt ever@@ est , making the entire building a 3,000 square meter ar@@ t@@ work .
so basically , bak@@ u is this sort of c@@ res@@ cent bay over@@ looking the island of zi@@ ra , the island that we are planning -- almost like the diagra@@ m of their fla@@ g .
but i am going talk about : what are the big problems in the world ?
but of course , there &apos;s a problem in asking people to focus on problems .
so it doesn &apos;t mean that we are not pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing -- any decision is a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zation , so of course we are still pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing , if only im@@ plic@@ it@@ ly -- and that &apos;s un@@ likely to be as good as if we actually did the pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zation , and went in and talked about it .
and what they basically did was come out with a pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zed list .
it &apos;s not saying that it &apos;s not a big problem .
the fourth best problem is malaria -- dealing with malaria .
basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do x amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ ven@@ tion .
even if it doesn &apos;t accor@@ d to the typical way we see this problem .
so we actually invited 80 young people from all over the world to come and solve the same problem .
who could bl@@ ame them ?
and they have also decided to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze economic rights over political rights .
that is the system that seems to work . &quot;
now i &apos;m sure some of you in the room will be thinking , well , this is like ce@@ ding to china , and this is a way , in other words , for the west to take a back seat .
i bring this to you to tell you that in 40 years , i &apos;ve gone from not being recogni@@ zed as a human being to standing in front of the illu@@ stri@@ ous ted crowd today to talk to you about my vie@@ ws .
that climate plays no role .
and if pau@@ la deci@@ des should she mar@@ ry joe or jack , somehow paul sounds the most interesting .
so in this case , it &apos;s an outside proje@@ ction for sing@@ apo@@ re on these giant times squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ like scre@@ ens .
so this is my min@@ i fabri@@ c farm .
using fru@@ it and vege@@ table sta@@ ining , create organic patter@@ ning .
so i guess what my question to you is : in the future , what would you choose to grow ?
here are a few .
journ@@ ali@@ stic co@@ verage of chinese fac@@ tor@@ ies , on the other hand , plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make .
once , when m@@ in &apos;s older sister &apos;s friend got married , she brought a hand@@ bag along as a we@@ d@@ ding present .
this pur@@ se is also a re@@ min@@ der that the things that you imagine , sitting in your office or in the library , are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world .
today , i want you to look at children who become su@@ i@@ cide bom@@ bers through a completely different l@@ ens .
then they ship them off , hundreds of miles away to har@@ d-@@ line schools that run along the taliban agenda .
he killed 22 .
however , the impli@@ cations of those results -- of a possible environment within this moon that could support pre@@ bio@@ tic chemistry , and perhaps life itself -- were so exciting that , in the interven@@ ing two years , we have focused more on en@@ cel@@ a@@ du@@ s .
it &apos;s always re@@ min@@ ded me of the apo@@ ll@@ o image of the earth , the blue mar@@ ble picture , and it &apos;s simil@@ arly meant to suggest , i think , that we can &apos;t really understand it as a whole .
but , in fact , it is . there is a real world of the internet out there , and that &apos;s what i spent about two years vis@@ iting , these places of the internet . i was in large data centers that use as much power as the cities in which they sit , and i vis@@ ited places like this , 60 hu@@ d@@ son street in new york , which is one of the buildings in the world , one of a very short list of buildings , about a do@@ zen buildings , where more networks of the internet connect to each other than anywhere else .
they have -- this is literally a be@@ am of light around the world , and if a c@@ able brea@@ ks in the pacific , it &apos;ll send it around the other direction . and then having done that , they started to look for places to wire next .
and we should know , i think , we should know where our internet comes from , and we should know what it is that physi@@ cally , physi@@ cally conne@@ cts us all .
and that data , layer by layer , gets passed through the machine , starting at the base of the product and de@@ pos@@ iting material , layer upon layer , inf@@ using the new layer of materials to the old layer in an addi@@ tive process .
it &apos;s created de@@ pos@@ iting la@@ yers of about four mi@@ cr@@ ons .
there &apos;s a lower chance of re@@ je@@ ction .
there &apos;s no need to do a run of thousands of millions or send that product to be inje@@ ction mol@@ ded in china .
this means lower carbon foot@@ print .
we &apos;re all different si@@ zes and our companies the same .
we just as@@ sum@@ ed that if this in@@ san@@ e man and his psych@@ op@@ ath@@ ic follo@@ wers were calling what they did ji@@ had , then that &apos;s what ji@@ had must mean .
the weal@@ thy fan@@ a@@ tics who were previ@@ ously spon@@ sor@@ ing this kind of activity are now less gener@@ ous .
so i think we &apos;ve come to a point now where we can say that , just like all politics , all ji@@ had is local .
who killed bin la@@ den@@ ism ? al ja@@ ze@@ era did , al ja@@ ze@@ era and half a do@@ zen other satelli@@ te news sta@@ tions in arab@@ ic , because they circum@@ v@@ ented the old , stat@@ e-@@ ow@@ ned television sta@@ tions in a lot of these countries which were designed to keep information from people .
to the real ji@@ had we can say , &quot; wel@@ come back . good lu@@ ck . &quot;
and it was here that i met jan@@ e .
and so she can &apos;t move out .
it &apos;s an opportunity to truly build a world where we can ex@@ tend services and products to all human beings , so that they can make decisions and choices for themselves .
so i did .
i started reading popular science magazine , and i got really excited about the potential of solar energy to try and solve that crisis .
and i started looking at how we could build battery back@@ -up systems that could give people five hours , 10 hours , maybe even a full day , or three days &apos; worth of back@@ -up power .
i &apos;ll be very short on genetic algorith@@ ms .
we looked at a way to break up a par@@ ab@@ ol@@ a into individual pe@@ t@@ als that would track .
you could now get a lot more power in a lot smaller space , and that allowed the engine to be used for mobile appli@@ cations .
so someone came up with a very clever idea , to -- instead of he@@ ating the whole cy@@ lin@@ der and cool@@ ing the whole cy@@ lin@@ der , what about if you put a dis@@ plac@@ er inside -- a little thing that shu@@ tt@@ les the air back and forth .
so it &apos;s a complete rever@@ si@@ ble cycle , a very efficient cycle , and quite a simple thing to make .
let me show you a quick movie of what this looks like running .
and of course , look at africa .
thank you very much , you &apos;ve been a great audience .
atmosp@@ her@@ ic explo@@ sions , or full com@@ bu@@ sti@@ on , takes about 1@@ 5,000 times longer than what happens in your car .
and when one student like me has some sort of in@@ clin@@ ation or understanding about that molecule , they write one scientific paper on the subject .
but i gave him the money , because i was from ri@@ ver@@ d@@ ale so i had more money than he did .
and i have a beautiful page of do@@ od@@ les from jon@@ a@@ than wo@@ od@@ ham &apos;s talk .
and with him , i was able to do a project that was really fantastic .
&quot; would , could , should , or would , should , could . &quot;
and then he died , and there was no more spin@@ o@@ za . extin@@ ct .
well , not so awful .
ok . i ta@@ ped my -- my a@@ unt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85 .
i happen to be alive , end of discussion . thank you .
when i was 14 , i es@@ cap@@ ed from ti@@ bet and became even further re@@ moved from my mother and father , my rela@@ tives , my friends and my hom@@ eland .
t@@ d : so , with reg@@ ard to the development that we &apos;ve been talking about here at this conference , i really feel that the development that we make shouldn &apos;t create a further bur@@ den for us as human beings , but should be used to improve our fundamental lifest@@ yle t@@ d : of course , i re@@ jo@@ ice in the development and the growth and the rise of the no@@ ble land of india , the great country of india , but at the same time , i think , as some of us have ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged , we need to be aware that some aspe@@ cts of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand .
very soon they &apos;ll be doing everything for us .
this is the last cycle , and you can see it &apos;s pretty much figured out what its self looks like . and once it has a self-@@ model , it can use that to der@@ i@@ ve a pattern of lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion .
so a pla@@ gue out@@ break in sur@@ at , india becomes not an ob@@ sc@@ ure event , but a glob@@ alized event -- a glob@@ alized conc@@ ern that has changed the risk equ@@ ation .
and of course it will be hu@@ gely dis@@ rup@@ tive in prepar@@ ation plans .
and 40 states already have an ac@@ ute nur@@ sing shor@@ tage .
you &apos;re the ma@@ yo@@ r of your local town .
or can we get away with some different kinds of mas@@ ks ?
and so we ended up with this wild pat@@ ch@@ work of regu@@ lations all over america .
how many mas@@ ks do you need ?
but i would say that hon@@ est@@ ly we don &apos;t know .
it tells you if you have h@@ 5@@ n@@ 1 .
so what &apos;s going on here is your body says , your imm@@ une system sen@@ ds out all its sent@@ in@@ els and says , &quot; i don &apos;t know what the he@@ ck this is .
&#91; 6 mile range &#93; &#91; top speed near 20@@ mp@@ h &#93; &#91; u@@ ph@@ ill clim@@ bing &#93; &#91; re@@ gener@@ ative bra@@ king &#93; so we &apos;re going to show you what this thing can do .
so please join me for a minute of sil@@ ence .
i be@@ friend a young ju@@ g@@ gl@@ er in a ju@@ g@@ gling trou@@ pe , and he agre@@ es to sell me three clu@@ bs .
now i have been playing with rop@@ es and clim@@ bing all my childhood , so that &apos;s it . i &apos;m 16 ; i &apos;m becoming a wire wal@@ ker .
manhattan no longer spre@@ ads its infin@@ ity .
so you don &apos;t want me to street ju@@ g@@ gle here , right ?
i stop in the middle .
they had become one , pus@@ hing me to tri@@ um@@ ph .
because of the over@@ han@@ ging leaves and bran@@ ches , you &apos;ll notice that the under@@ story is very dark , it &apos;s very still .
i was interested , and my can@@ op@@ y resear@@ cher colleagues have been interested in the dynam@@ ics of the can@@ op@@ y plants that live in the forest .
and so , that &apos;s what i &apos;ve begin doing , and so i &apos;d like to un@@ v@@ eil the international can@@ op@@ y network here .
this experience of working with du@@ ke also led me to initi@@ ate a program called sound science .
because the prison war@@ dens were very enth@@ usi@@ a@@ stic about this as well , i started a science and sustain@@ ability se@@ min@@ ar in the pris@@ ons .
a unique ecosystem of plants , birds and mon@@ keys thri@@ ves in the tre@@ et@@ ops of the rain@@ forest . n@@ al@@ in@@ i na@@ d@@ kar@@ n@@ i explor@@ es these can@@ op@@ y worl@@ ds -- and shares her fin@@ dings with the world below , through dance , art and b@@ old partner@@ ships .
it was an example of a culture clas@@ h that &apos;s happening all over the world between be@@ wi@@ g@@ ged and be@@ stock@@ in@@ ged offi@@ ci@@ als who think that they can rule over us without very much pr@@ ying from the public , and then suddenly con@@ fron@@ ted with a public who is no longer content with that arr@@ ange@@ ment , and not only not content with it , now , more often , ar@@ med with offi@@ cial data itself .
it zo@@ oms it off to the appropriate person , it tells you when the time li@@ mit is coming to an end , it kee@@ ps track of all the cor@@ respon@@ dence , it po@@ sts it up there , and it becomes an archi@@ ve of public knowledge .
you &apos;ve got to have skep@@ tic@@ ism and hu@@ mili@@ ty .
they &apos;ve kid@@ ded out the house with c@@ c@@ tv c@@ ameras .
i had to focus all my energi@@ es towards going to find new species of things down on deep coral re@@ ef@@ s .
and the effect of that pressure is that you have an increas@@ ed den@@ sity of gas molecules in every breath you take .
at the time , i wasn &apos;t the only one who didn &apos;t know what i was doing -- almost nobody did .
and , the other compon@@ ent on a brea@@ thing loo@@ p is the carbon dio@@ xi@@ de absor@@ b@@ ent can@@ i@@ ster .
this is the high-@@ tech g@@ ad@@ ge@@ try that allows us to do what we do on these kinds of deep di@@ ves .
now little fis@@ hes and in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates aren &apos;t the only things we see down there .
so sharks aren &apos;t quite as dangerous as most people make them out to be .
when we first found it , we weren &apos;t even sure what family this thing bel@@ on@@ ged to , so we just called it the dr . se@@ uss fish , because it looked like something out of one of those books .
he had an oxygen to@@ xic@@ ity sei@@ z@@ ure and he dro@@ w@@ ned .
but here &apos;s what really per@@ ple@@ x@@ ed me .
and his communication and social interaction were impro@@ ved so dra@@ matically that he was en@@ roll@@ ed into a regular school and even became a kar@@ ate super ch@@ amp .
we only meet them once .
roll that ta@@ pe .
n@@ k : yeah . no not lou@@ is far@@ ra@@ k@@ han , lou@@ is ka@@ hn .
but i think he has given us this building and we feel all the time for him , that &apos;s why , he has given love for us .
what if , out there , others are asking and ans@@ wer@@ ing similar questions ?
well , what about 10 ^ 22 ?
and that &apos;s the l@@ ength of time that the earth was li@@ fel@@ ess .
and in 1960 , frank dra@@ ke condu@@ cted the first se@@ ti obser@@ vation looking at two stars , ta@@ u c@@ et@@ i and ep@@ sil@@ on eri@@ dan@@ i , for about 150 hours .
and it wouldn &apos;t simply change everything , it would change everything all at once . &quot;
the se@@ ti institute &apos;s j@@ ill tar@@ ter makes her prize wish : to acceler@@ ate our search for co@@ s@@ mic company . using a growing ar@@ ray of radio telescop@@ es , she and her team listen for patterns that may be a sign of intelligence el@@ se@@ where in the universe .
it makes for an ex@@ o@@ tic and chil@@ ly com@@ mu@@ te .
don &apos;t we already know how they affect temper@@ atures ?
science colum@@ n@@ ist lee hot@@ z descri@@ bes a remarkable project at wa@@ is divi@@ de , ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a , where a har@@ dy team are dri@@ ll@@ ing into ten@@ -@@ thou@@ sand@@ -year-old ice to extra@@ ct vi@@ tal data on our changing climate .
on the competi@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess front , we all know that to@@ y@@ ota has more market ca@@ p than the big three put together .
and we &apos;ll also get re@@ turns over 150 billion dollars a year .
in fact , since 95 percent of the weight you &apos;re moving is the car not the driver , less than one percent of the fuel energy ends up moving the driver .
because the auto body has only , say , 14 parts , instead of 100 , 150 .
now , to make this happen quick@@ er and with higher confidence , there is a few ways government could help .
then we need to re@@ tool the car industry and do re@@ training , and shift the conver@@ gen@@ ce of the energy and ag@@ -@@ value cha@@ ins to shift faster from hydro@@ carb@@ ons to car@@ bo@@ hy@@ dr@@ ates , and get out of our own way in other ways .
these people aren &apos;t that smart .
so we feel that we &apos;ve formed a successful online community with girls .
girl 5 : for a girl &apos;s game also usually they &apos;ll have really pretty sc@@ ener@@ y with clou@@ ds and flo@@ wers .
he &apos;s invited all the best people .
b@@ l : thanks .
bring me a can@@ v@@ as and some paint , and i will paint a ver@@ meer much better than i sold that dis@@ gu@@ sting na@@ z@@ i .
well there &apos;s an answer that many people would give .
it &apos;s very simple : po@@ ur it from an expensive bot@@ tle .
now often , a result of cap@@ gras syndro@@ me is tra@@ gic .
so one answer was george clo@@ on@@ ey .
okay . who here , it does nothing for them ?
the second example from music is from john c@@ age &apos;s moder@@ n@@ ist com@@ position , &quot; 4 &apos; 3@@ 3 &quot; . &quot;
and i &apos;ll end with that . thank you .
it &apos;s like a con@@ sent@@ ing intellectual s &amp; amp ; m activity .
this is a head@@ line from the daily tele@@ graph in the u.@@ k .
and this is the trial of fish oil p@@ ills .
so we know , for example , that two sugar p@@ ills a day are a more effective treatment for getting rid of ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ cers than one sugar p@@ ill .
everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than ris@@ peri@@ done , so you see a bunch of trials compar@@ ing new anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs against ris@@ peri@@ done at eight milli@@ gra@@ ms a day .
if there is publi@@ c@@ ation bi@@ as , if small negative trials have gone missing in action , you can see it on one of these graph@@ s .
and they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will reduce the rate of compli@@ cations with flu .
so i imagine my life : if a hundred years ago china had been the most powerful nation in the world and they came to the united states in search of coal , and they found it , and , in fact , they found lots of it right here .
and before we know it , they send in the tan@@ ks and then send in the tro@@ ops , and lots of people are dying , and it &apos;s a very , very difficult situation .
number one : this in@@ cur@@ sion into your land these past 20 years , and before , the reason anyone is interested in your land , and particularly the united states , it &apos;s oil .
something else you see that you talk about -- americans don &apos;t talk about this , but you do .
there &apos;s something else about them that you see -- they don &apos;t see themselves .
and you &apos;re thinking , &quot; god , if this guy is saying that , then all the soldiers must be saying that . &quot;
and then your cou@@ sin says , &quot; hey cu@@ z , check out this website .
so here .
so it &apos;s all about coal , and the chinese are here in the united states .
which one ?
and they build a big , complex world .
today a con@@ tain@@ er ship can carry 1@@ 50,000 tons ; it can be man@@ ned with a smaller cre@@ w ; and un@@ lo@@ aded faster than ever before .
and by that i mean it &apos;s products for which the research and development costs are really high , and the manufacturing costs are low .
as other countries become ri@@ cher the demand for these pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als is going to increase tremend@@ ously .
but consider the following : if the world as a whole were as weal@@ thy as the united states is now there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers contribu@@ ting to ideas which benefit everyone , which are shared by everyone .
19@@ 00@@ s : maybe one percent .
oil . oil . this was a big top@@ ic .
i &apos;ve come , however , on a special mission on be@@ half of my const@@ it@@ u@@ ency , which are the 10@@ -@@ to-@@ the-@@ 18@@ th-@@ power -- that &apos;s a million trilli@@ on -- insects and other small creatures , and to make a ple@@ a for them .
consider the f@@ ung@@ i -- including mus@@ h@@ rooms , ru@@ sts , mol@@ ds and many dise@@ as@@ e-@@ caus@@ ing organisms .
soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequen@@ cers on our bac@@ ks -- to h@@ unt bacteria in tiny cre@@ vices of the habit@@ at &apos;s surface in the way you go watching for birds with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars .
the hi@@ pp@@ o ju@@ g@@ ger@@ n@@ aut we have created , if un@@ ab@@ ated , is dest@@ ined -- according to the best esti@@ mates of on@@ going bio@@ diversity research -- to reduce half of earth &apos;s still survi@@ ving animal and plant species to extin@@ ction or critical en@@ danger@@ ment by the end of the century .
it has an in@@ definitely exp@@ and@@ able page for each species .
what happened ?
it was hun@@ ted until there were just a few left to die in zo@@ os .
gene@@ tically , the band@@ -@@ ta@@ iled pi@@ ge@@ on already is mostly living pas@@ sen@@ ger pi@@ ge@@ on .
another amazing story came from al@@ ber@@ to fern@@ á@@ n@@ de@@ z@@ -@@ ari@@ as .
so what do you do about that ?
that &apos;s how comfortable these wild gor@@ ill@@ as are with vis@@ it@@ ors .
i sus@@ pe@@ ct there are some people out there sitting , kind of asking tor@@ mented questions , almost , about , well , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait a minute , there &apos;s something wrong with man@@ kind inter@@ fer@@ ing in nature in this way .
and they suppor@@ ted my creative eff@@ or@@ ts , because my grand@@ father was a self-@@ made man .
so i love that last sentence : &quot; he liked making this book . &quot;
so how did i make friends ?
and a video camera .
i gradu@@ ated from ris@@ d . my grand@@ parents were very proud , and i moved to boston , and i set up shop .
m@@ rs . al@@ isch was there . mr . sh@@ il@@ ale was there . m@@ rs . cas@@ ey was there .
and it dis@@ played the work from my first 10 years of publi@@ sh@@ ing , and you know who was there to celebra@@ te ? m@@ rs . al@@ isch .
let me give you some examples from a couple of areas which i think we all care about : health and education .
now that doesn &apos;t mean they only get half their education , but it does mean they have to work very hard to join the dots and understand what &apos;s going on .
it may not be pus@@ hing the boat out too far to suggest that many teachers are losing significant life expec@@ tan@@ cy by teaching in environments like that day after day .
my friend richard ma@@ zu@@ ch , an architect in london , co@@ ined the phr@@ ase &quot; invisible architecture . &quot;
this is not a box ; these are the ren@@ der@@ ings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life .
i was a little nervous per@@ forming without anima@@ tion , co@@ stu@@ me -- really -- and ma@@ ke@@ -up .
it &apos;s a human and technologi@@ cal revolution .
in the last year ?
in the train bra@@ kes -- at least in the ger@@ man train bra@@ kes -- there &apos;s this part of the bra@@ ke that &apos;s made of bone ash .
so i sent this company an email saying , &quot; hell@@ o . i &apos;m chri@@ sti@@ en . i &apos;m doing this research .
chri@@ sti@@ en mein@@ der@@ ts@@ ma : how pi@@ g parts make the world turn
you ever thought about that ?
i deser@@ ve the education that i get here .
can we stand to have more relationships ? absolutely .
the world wide web , the french are told , ought to be refer@@ red to as &quot; la toi@@ le d &apos;@@ ar@@ a@@ ig@@ nee mon@@ di@@ ale &quot; -- the global spi@@ der web -- re@@ com@@ men@@ da@@ tions that the french ga@@ ily ignor@@ e .
so a temp@@ ting gener@@ alization for a child , for an adult , for a computer is that any ver@@ b that can appear in the construction , &quot; subje@@ c@@ t-@@ verb@@ -@@ th@@ ing-@@ to-@@ a-@@ reci@@ pi@@ ent &quot; can also be expres@@ sed as &quot; subje@@ c@@ t-@@ verb@@ -@@ reci@@ pi@@ ent@@ -@@ thing . &quot;
first , there &apos;s a level of fin@@ e-@@ gra@@ ined concep@@ tual structure , which we auto@@ matically and un@@ consci@@ ously compu@@ te every time we produce or u@@ tter a sentence , that gover@@ ns our use of language .
and i &apos;ll start out with a puzz@@ le , the puzz@@ le of indi@@ rect speech acts .
if two friends have a reci@@ pro@@ cal trans@@ action , like selling a car , it &apos;s well known that this can be a source of ten@@ sion or aw@@ k@@ war@@ dness .
the honest off@@ ic@@ er can &apos;t hold you to it as being a bri@@ be , and therefore , you get the nu@@ is@@ ance of the traffic ti@@ cket .
yeah , we have those argu@@ ments too .
you know , pres@@ enting a sound , well-@@ argu@@ ed , ti@@ ght argument in english before a fran@@ cop@@ h@@ one audience just isn &apos;t going to work .
we don &apos;t get anywhere .
so how can we find ways to make argu@@ ments y@@ i@@ el@@ d something positive ?
dan@@ iel h . co@@ hen : for argument &apos;s sa@@ ke
that &apos;s bio@@ process@@ ing , you know ; that &apos;s bio@@ -@@ assi@@ sted technology : using an organis@@ m to do your wa@@ ste@@ water treatment is an old , old technology called &quot; dom@@ est@@ ic@@ ation . &quot;
what had happened was that they realized that there were organisms out there that had already solved the problems that they had spent their care@@ ers trying to solve .
and it &apos;s car@@ ving things down from the top , with 9@@ 6 percent waste left over and only 4 percent product . you heat it up ; you beat it with high pres@@ sur@@ es ; you use chemicals . ok . heat , beat and treat .
imagine being able to make cer@@ am@@ ics at room temperature by simply di@@ pping something into a liquid , li@@ f@@ ting it out of the liquid , and having ev@@ apo@@ ration force the molecules in the liquid together , so that they j@@ ig@@ saw together in the same way as this cr@@ y@@ stal@@ li@@ zation works .
that &apos;s very exciting for fuel cells -- to be able to do that without plat@@ in@@ um .
it &apos;s not easy , because life uses only a sub@@ set of the elements in the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table .
j@@ b : ok , put this -- ok , i &apos;ll just hold this thing . ok , great .
we do not invest in vic@@ ti@@ ms , we invest in survi@@ vor@@ s .
so i asked her , &quot; how in the world do you know this much about business ?
because we a@@ im low and we think small when it comes to women .
i think that is terri@@ fic .
and when i would feel sorry for myself as nine or 10 year-old girls do , she would say to me , &quot; my de@@ ar , on a scale of major world trage@@ dies , y@@ ours is not a three . &quot;
it was u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous .
and for the most part , the stories are recycl@@ ed .
or worse , you let it run until it &apos;s warm to rin@@ se out your to@@ we@@ l .
and then you get to the fin@@ ish@@ es , the subject of all of those &quot; go green &quot; artic@@ les , and on the scale of a house they almost make no difference at all .
and it started , as with many great ideas , or many ideas you can &apos;t get rid of anyway , at a cock@@ tail party .
they &apos;re found everywhere on the planet except for the arc@@ tic and the southern ti@@ p of south america .
that &apos;s the part where the researchers fre@@ ak out .
so what &apos;s significant about this isn &apos;t that cro@@ ws are using cars to cra@@ ck nu@@ ts .
then you can come back any@@ time and get yourself a pe@@ an@@ ut .
instead , i think we should look a little bit larger .
and in the pi@@ le were things like zero ta@@ xes for 20 years , or that we &apos;d help to build a new factory for the company , said they would offer un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented conc@@ essi@@ ons , sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ces to just keep those jobs in green@@ ville .
you might say ob@@ ama@@ care , except for those were not volun@@ t@@ ary changes .
along the eastern se@@ abo@@ ard , we &apos;re going to lead the nation in off@@ sh@@ ore wind .
i think that social media is actually going to help us dis@@ man@@ tle some of the sil@@ ly and de@@ meaning ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ es that we see in media and adverti@@ sing about gender .
but they &apos;re having a hard time doing it because they &apos;re still trying to use demo@@ graphi@@ cs in order to understand them , because that &apos;s how ad rates are still determin@@ ed .
this is far too simpli@@ stic .
yeah . and as i drive through a neighborhood , say , where people got@@ -@@ a-@@ lot@@ ta , i &apos;ll take a mo@@ ck@@ ing@@ bird i caught in a neighborhood where folks a@@ in &apos;t got na@@ da and just let it go , you know .
space is l@@ ength and bre@@ ad@@ th continu@@ ed in@@ definitely , but you cannot buy a ti@@ cket to travel commer@@ cially to space in america because countries are beginning to eat like us , live like us and die like us .
the ti@@ tle is &quot; obser@@ va@@ tions of in-@@ u@@ ter@@ o ma@@ stur@@ b@@ ation . &quot;
so i intervie@@ wed her in o@@ a@@ kl@@ and , in a sus@@ hi restaurant .
but it would be an or@@ gas@@ m -- non@@ eth@@ eless .
if you go all the way back to hi@@ p@@ po@@ cr@@ ates , physi@@ cians believed that or@@ gas@@ m in women was not just hel@@ p@@ ful for con@@ ception , but necessary .
sper@@ m that sit around in the body for a week or more start to develop ab@@ norm@@ ali@@ ties that make them less effective at head@@ -@@ ban@@ ging their way into the eg@@ g .
okay . now i said -- when i was in den@@ mark , my ho@@ st was named an@@ ne mar@@ ie .
there is a ph@@ all@@ us , clear ac@@ r@@ y@@ lic ph@@ all@@ us , with a camera and a light source , atta@@ ched to a motor that is kind of going like this .
the school where he gradu@@ ated from with his master &apos;s had just off@@ ered him a teaching ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment , which meant not only a sal@@ ary , but benefits for the first time in ages .
however , i also have reason to believe that many , if not most , of you are actually t@@ ying your shoes in@@ cor@@ rec@@ tly .
this is a little hard for children , but i think you can hand@@ le it .
yeah , i kind of felt sorry for him .
we s@@ wis@@ s are famous for cho@@ col@@ ate and che@@ ese . our tra@@ ins run on time .
you can see now , that &apos;s a good example : even be@@ having in an or@@ der@@ ly , syste@@ matic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos .
but i think it could still benefit from more discipl@@ ine .
it &apos;s -- oh , no , it &apos;s -- that &apos;s a really hard one .
but before leaving i would like to show you , i &apos;m working right now on another -- in a related field with my ti@@ dying up art method . i &apos;m working in a related field .
and design was in everything my dad did .
i roll swi@@ ft@@ ly through an air@@ port , right ?
the difference is in@@ tent .
he &apos;s something very , very different .
no , i don &apos;t think a designer did come up with that .
what was going on then ?
in the middle of this chaos , i &apos;m roll@@ ing around in a whe@@ el@@ chair , and i was completely invisible . completely .
an object de@@ vo@@ id of in@@ tent -- it &apos;s random , it &apos;s im@@ it@@ ative , it re@@ p@@ els us . it &apos;s like a piece of jun@@ k mail to be thro@@ wn away .
i didn &apos;t have a phone number to call to say i was coming .
&quot; be care@@ ful , ab@@ ed , look out . slow down . &quot;
was i what had been done to me ?
he led me to a house of cre@@ am stu@@ c@@ co , then dro@@ ve off .
and so i didn &apos;t point out that in his own te@@ stim@@ ony the morning after the crash , ab@@ ed did not even mention the bus driver .
i for@@ got my dis@@ cre@@ tion .
but most of all , i wi@@ shed to tell him what her@@ man mel@@ ville wrote , that &quot; truly to enjoy bo@@ di@@ ly war@@ m@@ th , some small part of you must be cold , for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is mer@@ ely by contr@@ ast . &quot;
this is at the kore@@ an advanced institute of science and technology .
this is one of our robots that we showed at wired ne@@ x@@ t@@ fest a couple of years ago .
now , any of those stat@@ s should convince each of us to get off our du@@ ff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t .
even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand ted videos , it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so .
so here are some of the results that i received . i think they &apos;re quite nice .
there were others , and i found this quite che@@ e@@ ky .
i wanted to have a thousand ted@@ talks sum@@ mar@@ i@@ zed into just six words -- which would be a 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9@@ 9@@ 9@@ 7 percent redu@@ ction in content .
finally , in part three , i &apos;m going to describe a co@@ sm@@ ological theory called inf@@ lation , which will pull all the pieces of the story together .
this number is small .
and in string theory , vi@@ bra@@ tion determin@@ es everything .
because those univer@@ ses that have much more dark energy than ours , whenever matter tries to cl@@ um@@ p into galaxies , the re@@ pul@@ sive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blo@@ ws the cl@@ um@@ p apart and galaxies don &apos;t form .
and that takes me to my final part , part three .
i &apos;ll conclu@@ de with a stri@@ king im@@ plic@@ ation of all these ideas for the very far future .
on the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
so let &apos;s move forward .
why not just , instead of pus@@ hing left and right with a mouse or with a jo@@ y@@ pad , why not use your body just to le@@ an on the chair -- again , rela@@ x@@ ed ?
and we &apos;ll do that in a second .
we &apos;re trying to introduce you to what i believe is the most wonderful part , you being able to talk in your natural voice to mil@@ o .
this looks nice .
great person .
i now cover sy@@ ri@@ a , and i started repor@@ ting it because i believed that it needs to be done .
when i go back to sy@@ ri@@ a , next week in fact , what i see is incredibly hero@@ ic people , some of them fighting for democracy , for things we take for gran@@ ted every single day .
but my m@@ é@@ tier is to bear wit@@ ness and that is the cru@@ x , the heart of the matter , for us repor@@ ters who do this .
and if we can actually provide feedback , sensor@@ y signals that go back from this robo@@ tic , mechan@@ ical , compu@@ ta@@ tional actu@@ ator that is now under the control of the brain , back to the brain , how the brain de@@ als with that , of recei@@ ving mes@@ sages from an artificial piece of machin@@ ery .
well , we did that 10 years ago .
the bottom picture is what happens when the body st@@ ops moving and the animal starts controll@@ ing either a robo@@ tic device or a compu@@ ta@@ tional a@@ vat@@ ar .
and i can only tell you that as a scientist , i grew up in southern brazil in the mid@@ - &apos; 6@@ 0s watching a few crazy guys telling &#91; us &#93; that they would go to the moon .
you &apos;re going to be spending the rest of your life in the ri@@ ce pa@@ d@@ dies .
of course , most of china was fl@@ our@@ ishing at the time , but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of china .
what &apos;s remarkable is that her brothers , in the same family , were totally fine .
so here is bill of arab@@ ia .
the baby died , and she ended up with a fi@@ st@@ ul@@ a .
he was kind of a gam@@ bl@@ er type -- and un@@ emplo@@ y@@ able , therefore -- and took his fru@@ stra@@ tions out on her .
one of them ended up with be@@ atri@@ ce &apos;s parents , and that go@@ at had tw@@ ins .
you learn from your mista@@ kes , and you continu@@ ously improve .
s@@ her@@ y@@ l wu@@ dun@@ n : our century &apos;s greatest in@@ justice
why wouldn &apos;t they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nu@@ ts that somebody else had already cra@@ cked open for them ?
and as a result , our ideas do accu@@ mu@@ late , and our technology pro@@ gr@@ esses .
so if we &apos;d cho@@ sen that path , our evolutionary path would have led into the forest -- and been a short one indeed .
once we have language , we can put our ideas together and co@@ operate to have a pro@@ sper@@ ity that we couldn &apos;t have before we ac@@ qui@@ red it .
and it &apos;s true ; there are places on that island where you can en@@ coun@@ ter a new language in under a mile .
and that question is whether in this modern , glob@@ alized world we can really afford to have all these different languages .
mark pa@@ gel : how language trans@@ formed humanity
every image is ac@@ comp@@ ani@@ ed with a very deta@@ iled f@@ actual text .
and in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to re@@ en@@ act a crime scene .
this , on a ligh@@ ter note , is at george lu@@ c@@ as &apos; personal archi@@ ve .
i investig@@ ate photograph@@ y &apos;s ability to blu@@ r truth and fi@@ ction , and its influence on memory , which can lead to sever@@ e , even le@@ th@@ al consequences .
lar@@ ry may@@ es , i photograph@@ ed at the scene of ar@@ rest , where he hi@@ d between two mat@@ tr@@ esses in g@@ ary , indi@@ ana , in this very room to hi@@ de from the police .
now , usually when people hear statistics or stat@@ s like that , you start thinking about places like haiti or other kind of ex@@ o@@ tic or maybe even im@@ pover@@ ished areas , but it happens right here in the united states every single year .
sounds like a great idea , but how do you make it real ?
i would watch no@@ va on p@@ bs .
here we have jun@@ o on its cru@@ ise to ju@@ pit@@ er , there .
i &apos;m going to pull out , and i want to show you vo@@ y@@ ager 1 as it flies by saturn .
we are wired to pur@@ sue happiness , not only to enjoy it , but to want more and more of it .
so for example , we &apos;re born lo@@ ving the taste of something swe@@ et and re@@ acting a@@ versi@@ vely to the taste of something bit@@ ter .
and it &apos;s been missing . it &apos;s been missing from psycho@@ therapy .
and the rat would just keep pres@@ sing that bar thousands and thousands and thousands of times .
we are social beings from the beginning .
now in the animal world , there is only one way to increase status , and that &apos;s domin@@ ance .
they went from attra@@ c@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess and happiness and wealth and self-@@ control to gener@@ osity and for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess .
actually , there was an appe@@ al worldwide for new dete@@ c@@ tors sustainable in the environments where they &apos;re needed to produce , which is main@@ ly in the developing world .
first of all , we associ@@ ate the click sound with a food reward , which is s@@ ma@@ shed ban@@ ana and pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts together in a sy@@ r@@ inge .
in tanz@@ ania -- the numbers don &apos;t lie -- 45 percent of people -- t@@ .b. patients -- get diagno@@ sed with t@@ .b. before they die .
micro@@ scop@@ y for 1,@@ 800 patients .
it can con@@ temp@@ late the meaning of infin@@ ity , ask questions about the meaning of its own existence , about the nature of god .
it &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s per@@ forming a virtual reality simulation of the other person &apos;s action .
and that is , there are mirror neurons , just as there are mirror neurons for action , there are mirror neurons for touch .
and this is not mu@@ m@@ bo@@ -@@ jum@@ bo philosoph@@ y .
the little hole in the middle , we &apos;ll come to a bit later , but that &apos;s for the pollen tube to come out later on . a very tiny tube .
now , it &apos;s much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bi@@ d@@ ding .
where has it been ?
so where we used to think of heart disease as being a man &apos;s problem pri@@ mar@@ ily -- which that was never true , but that was kind of how everybody thought in the 195@@ 0s and &apos; 6@@ 0s , and it was in all the text@@ books .
we &apos;ve done the research .
it was a very big deal for her to become director .
that &apos;s a man heart attack .
so that was a discovery .
these are our life@@ -@@ saving treat@@ ments .
now are we happy with this ?
breast cancer , as we said , kill@@ s women , but heart disease kill@@ s a whole bunch more .
well , the heart be@@ ats , rhyth@@ mi@@ cally , ti@@ rel@@ ess@@ ly , fa@@ i@@ th@@ fully .
&quot; we are what we eat , &quot; could easily be described as , &quot; we are what our cells eat . &quot;
coun@@ t@@ less moments of un@@ so@@ lic@@ ited natural moments , not posed moments , are cap@@ tured there , and we &apos;re starting to learn how to discover them and find them .
this is one of the first results that came out of our study a little over a year ago that really surprised us .
and finally , my son playing in a walking to@@ y by himself .
in my lab , which we &apos;re pe@@ ering into now , at mit -- this is at the media lab .
each of the links that you &apos;re seeing ren@@ dered here is an actual connection made between something someone said and a piece of content .
and so just to return to my son , when i was prepar@@ ing this talk , he was looking over my shoul@@ der , and i showed him the cli@@ ps i was going to show to you today , and i asked him for per@@ mission -- gran@@ ted .
de@@ b ro@@ y : the birth of a word
so that &apos;s the part of the brain that is activ@@ ated when you give a word to something .
so the point of this is what ?
the first again , is making ideas clear by visu@@ ali@@ zing them .
well , if that ru@@ ins your life , well then you shouldn &apos;t live there .
we &apos;ve got bub@@ bles going up there , then su@@ ds at the top with l@@ um@@ p@@ y ti@@ les .
oh , that &apos;s a cell phone .
second is , frie@@ dr@@ ich nie@@ tz@@ sche along about 18@@ 85 wrote a book ti@@ t@@ led &quot; the birth of trage@@ dy . &quot;
and they &apos;re doing a pretty good job there in the forest , working all the by@@ product of their industry -- with o@@ s@@ b and partic@@ le board and so forth and so on -- but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harv@@ est in the forest if consum@@ ers are wa@@ sting the harv@@ est at the point of consumption , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
so we all have in our head the perfect house , the american dream , which is a house , the dream house .
we buy stuff we didn &apos;t know we needed .
sometimes those guys are na@@ z@@ is , my oh my .
we can &apos;t even afford to eat anything except be@@ ans .
dan phil@@ li@@ ps : creative houses from rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed stuff
now to put this into a bro@@ a@@ der context , i want you to imagine that you are an e@@ ternal alien watching the earth from ou@@ ter space , and your favorite show on inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic satelli@@ te television is the earth chan@@ nel , and your favorite show is the human show .
that stati@@ stic is so sad .
the hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ e shape you can see on my sk@@ ul@@ l is where they oper@@ ated and went inside my brain to do the sur@@ ger@@ ies they needed to do to res@@ cu@@ e my life .
indeed , the mind can re@@ define itself , and this is demon@@ strated by two speci@@ alists called ha@@ gen and sil@@ va back in the 19@@ 70 &apos;s .
that was a fair question because my me@@ mo@@ ir was simply how i found solutions that worked for me .
the next issue that resol@@ ved was that , if 90 percent of head and ne@@ ck pain is caused by im@@ balance , the other 10 percent , lar@@ gely -- if you set asi@@ de an@@ eur@@ y@@ sms , brain cancer and hor@@ mon@@ al issues -- is the circu@@ lation .
it has been simul@@ ated and te@@ sted to end@@ ure in the body cor@@ ro@@ si@@ on-@@ free for over 80 years .
you know , when i heard sim@@ on &apos;s -- please sit down ; i just want to talk to him for a second -- when i read his book , i went to la to meet him .
but this is blin@@ king all the time . it &apos;s sending signals in real time .
about 10 years ago , i took on the task to teach global development to swe@@ dis@@ h under@@ graduate students . that was after having spent about 20 years together with african institutions studying hunger in africa , so i was sort of expected to know a little about the world .
and these were the developing countries : they had large families and they had relatively short lives .
we heard it in other forms . and who are these ?
i can spli@@ t ar@@ ab states . how are they ? same climate , same culture , same religion -- huge difference . even between neighb@@ ors .
and if i go down and look at ni@@ ger , where there was such a terrible fam@@ ine , la@@ stly , it &apos;s like this . the 20 percent poor@@ est of ni@@ ger is out here , and the 20 percent rich@@ est of south africa is there , and yet we tend to disc@@ uss on what solutions there should be in africa .
he only says , &quot; we can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and since , you know , i follow his orders , i &apos;ll do it .
so i went to indi@@ ana , which was actually as good as cal@@ tech in gene@@ tics , and bes@@ i@@ des , they had a really good bas@@ ket@@ ball team .
he certainly wasn &apos;t s@@ mil@@ ing when i got there , because he was some@@ what hu@@ mili@@ ated by pau@@ ling getting the al@@ ph@@ a heli@@ x , and the cambridge people fail@@ ing because they weren &apos;t chemi@@ sts .
and so there was the paper , and he pro@@ posed a three-@@ str@@ and@@ ed structure .
so i changed the lo@@ cations , and then we found the base pa@@ ir@@ ing , and fran@@ c@@ is immediately said the cha@@ ins run in absolute direc@@ tions .
feyn@@ man was a member , and t@@ eller , and friends of g@@ amo@@ w .
it &apos;s not a -- it &apos;s only a par@@ tial look , but it &apos;s a -- i think it &apos;s going to be very , very useful .
so what &apos;s the meaning of the contro@@ ls ?
one of the major problems with patent law is that , in the case that when you are su@@ ed by a patent tro@@ ll , the bur@@ den of pro@@ of that you did not in@@ fr@@ inge on the patent is actually on the de@@ f@@ end@@ ant , which means you have to prove that you do not in@@ fr@@ inge on the patent they &apos;re su@@ ing you on .
they &apos;re not under n@@ da either .
and i thought , &quot; i should patent this . &quot;
they really enjo@@ yed each other &apos;s company .
they shared a full cat@@ ered me@@ al of chicken and fish .
but to get us started , i want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world .
because i thought that had been er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated in the way that small@@ po@@ x had been er@@ a@@ dic@@ ated .
we &apos;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a ro@@ ot fire ; it can explo@@ de again if you don &apos;t s@@ nu@@ ff it out completely .
the second challenge we had was -- in contr@@ ast to the small@@ po@@ x v@@ acc@@ ine , which was very stable , and a single dose prote@@ cted you for life -- the polio v@@ acc@@ ine is incredibly fra@@ gi@@ le .
now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation -- more than 15 years , much longer than it should have -- but once it was built , the results were stri@@ king .
u@@ ma@@ r is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern nigeria .
but as we tried these extraordinary things , as people went to this trouble to try and re@@ work their tac@@ tics , we went back to the v@@ acc@@ ine -- it &apos;s a 50@@ -year-old v@@ acc@@ ine -- and we thought , sur@@ ely we can make a better v@@ acc@@ ine , so that when they finally get to these kids , we can have a better bang for our bu@@ ck .
the huge social movement that &apos;s been involved in polio er@@ a@@ dic@@ ation is ready to do way more for these children .
give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year .
we found this le@@ op@@ ard in a 2,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year-old ba@@ ob@@ ab tree in africa , the same tree that we found her mother in and her grandmother .
but we &apos;re really there see@@ king and se@@ arch@@ ing and fil@@ ming the i@@ con@@ ic cat@@ s .
but that &apos;s not always easy for us .
b@@ j : but when this little cu@@ b saw that i had vac@@ ated my seat and clim@@ bed to the back to get some camera ge@@ ar , she came in like a curious cat to come and investig@@ ate .
they ended up sle@@ eping for hours .
because there &apos;s a sport , there &apos;s an activity going on that we &apos;re all aware of , that we con@@ done .
be@@ ver@@ ly + der@@ e@@ ck j@@ ou@@ bert live in the bush , fil@@ ming and photograph@@ ing li@@ ons and le@@ op@@ ards in their natural habit@@ at . with stun@@ ning foot@@ age , they disc@@ uss their personal relationships with these ma@@ je@@ stic animals -- and their qu@@ est to save the big cat@@ s from human thre@@ ats .
wi@@ tt@@ gen@@ stein repli@@ ed , &quot; well , what would it have looked like if it had looked as though the earth was ro@@ tat@@ ing ? &quot;
and that &apos;s because in middle world , air fri@@ ction is always there .
&quot; really , &quot; for an animal , is whatever its brain needs it to be in order to as@@ s@@ ist its survival , and because different species live in different worl@@ ds , there will be a dis@@ com@@ for@@ ting variety of &quot; really &quot; s .
we could make a similar scale of im@@ prob@@ abilities ; nothing is totally impossible .
most scientists today sub@@ scri@@ be to a mechan@@ i@@ stic view of the mind : we &apos;re the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are ; our hor@@ mon@@ es are the way they are .
after high school , i left home to study and learn more about the world .
i saw new and previ@@ ously un@@ thin@@ k@@ able possibilities to live and contribu@@ te , both for myself and others in my circum@@ stance .
all right , big finish .
he created an experiment using a metal pla@@ te , co@@ vering it with sand and then bo@@ wing it to create the ch@@ la@@ dn@@ i patterns that you see here on the right .
so , for example , here on the left we can see a s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ ke as it would appear in nature .
they not only recor@@ ded history -- they helped change the course of history .
some sick and twi@@ sted people have found themselves s@@ nor@@ ting gal@@ va@@ o .
and if you are like me , a big , ge@@ e@@ ky , white , american guy , you tend to interact with a lot of other ge@@ e@@ ky , white , american guys .
this is the old economy .
when you start looking at what actually flo@@ ws on top of these networks , you get a very different picture .
and before you conclu@@ de that this is just a function of american tv news -- which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and i agree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful -- i &apos;ve been ma@@ pping eli@@ te media like the new york times , and i get the same thing .
you might have noticed , we haven &apos;t done all that well so far .
and if you think this is ab@@ sur@@ d , it &apos;s not .
she has one of the har@@ dest jobs in the world .
and so he &apos;s able to tell a story about this black@@ smith in ki@@ ber@@ a and turn it into a story about re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ing technology , about inno@@ v@@ ating from con@@ stra@@ int , about looking for inspiration based on re@@ using materials .
we have to fix the internet . we have to fix our education .
well , what we &apos;ve seen is the creation , in places like iraq and afghanistan , of democratic systems of government which haven &apos;t had any of those side benefits .
the point about democracy is not that it deli@@ vers legi@@ ti@@ mate , effective , pro@@ sper@@ ous rule of law .
r@@ ory ste@@ wart : why democracy matters
so , where are they from ?
i went to his home town .
so , why -- why and where -- did cho@@ p su@@ ey come from ?
so , you see different var@@ ie@@ ties of chinese food .
so whatever it was , it caused people to sort of be@@ have in a mass syn@@ chr@@ oni@@ zed way .
and this lo@@ go !
and the her@@ b@@ als , the bot@@ an@@ ical books of up to the late middle ages , the ren@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance are filled with pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions for caus@@ ing con@@ vul@@ sions to sha@@ ke the evil spi@@ ri@@ ts out .
and to their ama@@ z@@ ement , after it was over , he began speaking like he was perfectly well .
being someone who had had a very difficult childhood , a very difficult ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence -- it had to do with not quite poverty but close .
it was fo@@ unded in the ei@@ gh@@ te@@ ent@@ h century , the largest psychi@@ atri@@ c hospital in the state of connec@@ tic@@ ut , other than the huge public hospit@@ als that exi@@ sted at that time .
any of the results along the spectrum , from pretty bad to terrible , terrible , terrible is going to happen . if he does the best he can , he will have no further obs@@ essi@@ ons , probably no depression , but his affect will be dul@@ led , he will never go back to surgery , he will never be the lo@@ ving father that he was to his two children , his life will be changed . if he has the usual result , he will end up like &apos; one fle@@ w over the cu@@ ck@@ o@@ o &apos;s nest . &apos; and you know about that , just essentially in a stu@@ po@@ r the rest of his life . &quot;
every time i would begin thinking obs@@ essi@@ on@@ ally -- again , once more , after 20 sho@@ ck treat@@ ments -- i would say , &quot; ah , fu@@ ck it . &quot;
it &apos;s known by some people in new haven , obviously , but it is not generally known .
so there are challenges to be met .
and that was the 195@@ 0s .
i just think we &apos;re not seeing , at the moment , the huge opportunities open to us by the ability of people to co@@ operate in a world where either there was isol@@ a@@ tion@@ ism before or there was limited alli@@ an@@ ces based on conven@@ i@@ ence which never actually took you to deal with some of the central problems .
by tac@@ kl@@ ing the impossible , you make the impossible possible .
g@@ b : yes , but i think europe has got a position , which is 27 countries have already come together .
and god said , &quot; not this year , not in this decade , perhaps not in your lifetime . &quot;
so it &apos;s kind of different from what we &apos;re used to thinking about silk .
so as you see the film go in transpar@@ ently through there , and then ...
i mentioned it brie@@ fly at the beginning ; the protein is bio@@ de@@ gra@@ d@@ able and bio@@ com@@ pati@@ ble .
fi@@ or@@ enz@@ o omen@@ et@@ to shares 20 + aston@@ ishing new uses for silk , one of nature &apos;s most elegan@@ t materials -- in trans@@ mit@@ ting light , impro@@ ving sustain@@ ability , ad@@ ding strength and making medical le@@ ap@@ s and bo@@ unds . on stage , he shows a few intri@@ gu@@ ing it@@ em@@ s made of the ver@@ sa@@ ti@@ le stuff .
if you like what &apos;s going on , show the green .
h@@ k : he &apos;s a french robot .
h@@ k : y@@ ay .
what can i learn with you ?
what if technologies could interven@@ e to help me find the person that i need right now ?
here is my father at age 19 .
indeed , it &apos;s rather small .
his parents were je@@ wish , russi@@ an and above all , very poor .
and actually , without knowing it , my father had invented something we can find in every scho@@ ol@@ child &apos;s pen@@ cil case : the so@@ -@@ called &quot; cor@@ rec@@ tion pen . &quot;
one day my father introduced me to my sister .
my father made fal@@ se pa@@ pers for the american deser@@ ters who did not wish to take up arms against the viet@@ nam@@ ese .
we live on a human@@ -@@ domin@@ ated planet , putting un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented pressure on the systems on earth .
now , you would have wi@@ shed the climate pressure to hit a strong planet , a resili@@ ent planet , but unfortunately , the third pressure is the ecosystem dec@@ line .
in my mind , the largest red fla@@ g war@@ ning for humanity that we are in a pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous situation .
now this is the big bang equivalent then of human development within the safe operating space of the planet@@ ary boundar@@ ies .
the austr@@ ali@@ an great bar@@ rier re@@ e@@ f is another success story .
so there is -- no dou@@ bt -- opportunity here , and we can list many , many examples of transforma@@ tive opportunities around the planet .
it wasn &apos;t until i actually did a book and a retro@@ spe@@ ctive exhi@@ bi@@ tion , that i could track exactly -- looks like all the cra@@ zi@@ est things that i had done , all my drin@@ king , all my par@@ ties -- they followed a straight line that brings me to the point that actually i &apos;m talking to you at this moment .
but i -- they didn &apos;t let me do it , so i just -- you know , they would only let me do other things .
they &apos;re called &quot; equi@@ val@@ ents , &quot; after al@@ fre@@ d stie@@ gli@@ tz &apos;s work .
so this is a ligh@@ thou@@ se .
like , you know , you have the skin particles of every single museum vis@@ it@@ or .
this is a pi@@ pe .
but nothing , of course , in nature is totally perfect , so sometimes an er@@ ror is made and a wrong letter is built in .
and together with the metho@@ ds to date these genetic differences , this has led to the insi@@ ght that modern humans -- humans that are essentially indi@@ st@@ ingu@@ is@@ hab@@ le from you and me -- evolved in africa , quite recently , between 100 and 200@@ ,000 years ago .
so what this means now is that those tra@@ its we then look at and so re@@ adi@@ ly see -- fac@@ ial fe@@ atures , skin color , hair structure -- are not determin@@ ed by single genes with big effects , but are determin@@ ed by many different genetic vari@@ ants that seem to v@@ ary in frequ@@ ency between different parts of the world .
and that &apos;s indeed the case .
then modern humans emer@@ ged somewhere in africa , came out of africa , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly in the middle east .
i &apos;m working in a team with air@@ bus , and we have created our vision about a more sustainable future of a@@ vi@@ ation .
and my belief is that we will get more and more new materials which we can put into structure later on , because structure is one of the key issues in air@@ craft design .
so how might the airplane of the future look ?
extremely , extremely isol@@ ated .
you would do something , because it &apos;s literally impossible to pen@@ et@@ rate somebody &apos;s physical space and not get a reaction .
when i started in this field , we thought that there were four individuals with autis@@ m per 10,000 , a very rare condition .
i remember when i inter@@ ac@@ ted with that 15@@ -@@ mon@@ th-@@ older , that the thing that came to mind was , &quot; how do you come into her world ?
it starts way up here , but then it &apos;s a free fall .
we want that the next generations of individuals with autis@@ m will be able not only to express their streng@@ ths but to ful@@ fill their promise .
then they give you , &quot; get ready . &quot;
so then you look around , you &apos;re under a can@@ op@@ y and you say , &quot; this is good . &quot;
but things had changed ; i was a 4@@ 6@@ -year-old bri@@ ga@@ di@@ er general .
first , the things that are obvious , that you &apos;re familiar with : the environment changed -- the speed , the sc@@ ru@@ tiny , the sensi@@ tivity of everything now is so fast , sometimes it evol@@ ves faster than people have time to really refle@@ ct on it .
i went down to be with a ran@@ ger plat@@ o@@ on on an operation in afghanistan , and on that operation , a ser@@ ge@@ ant in the plat@@ o@@ on had lost about half his arm thro@@ wing a taliban hand gren@@ ade back at the ene@@ my after it had land@@ ed in his fire team .
and you have to watch and take care of each other .
you can get kno@@ cked down , and it hur@@ ts and it leaves sc@@ ars .
and she poin@@ ted to the work on the left to tell me how proble@@ matic this image was , as it related , for her , to the idea of how black people had been repres@@ ented .
a profound stat@@ ement about the individual and the community .
so the last i@@ ter@@ ation of this project has been called flow , with the idea now of creating a real network of artists around the world ; really looking , not so much from har@@ lem and out , but looking across , and flow looked at artists all born on the continent of africa .
they did all of this in four hours after seeing the computer for the first time .
and when you &apos;ve got interest , then you have education .
and i set myself and impossible target : can tam@@ il speaking 12@@ -year-old children in a south indian village teach themselves biot@@ echn@@ ology in english on their own ?
whatever the expression , it was not very nice .
and i expla@@ ined to them that , you know , a lot of scientific research is done using that method .
teacher : you can &apos;t catch me .
the children looked at it and said , &quot; what ? &quot;
thanks .
it wasn &apos;t going to be written down . it was no news .
and being a theater person , what i know and love about the theater is that when the audience comes in and they sus@@ p@@ end their dis@@ belief , when you see men walking or women walking with a plat@@ ter of gr@@ ass on their heads , you know it &apos;s the sa@@ van@@ na .
so now , let &apos;s take a look at some of the images from &quot; the temp@@ est . &quot;
and it was the sand ca@@ st@@ le , the idea of nur@@ ture versus nature , that we build these civili@@ zations -- she spea@@ ks about it at the end , hel@@ en mir@@ ren &apos;s pro@@ sper@@ a -- we build them , but under nature , under the grand temp@@ est , these clou@@ d-@@ ca@@ pped to@@ wers , these gor@@ ge@@ ous pal@@ ac@@ es will fa@@ de and there will -- leave not a ra@@ ck behind .
p@@ p : they believe . j@@ t : o@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h . what was that ?
and you just stay going forward , and then you see this extraordinary thing in front of your eyes .
and with that confidence sur@@ ge , i thought , &quot; well , it &apos;s time to create a real bak@@ ery , so let &apos;s paint it . &quot; and the women said , &quot; that &apos;s a really great idea . &quot;
i think andre@@ w pretty well covered that , so i will move to the third point , which is that markets alone also are not going to solve the problems of poverty .
they buy it , they dry it and they bring it to this factory , which was pur@@ ch@@ ased in part by , again , patient capital from no@@ v@@ arti@@ s , who has a real interest in getting the po@@ w@@ der so that they can make co@@ ar@@ tem .
and so , an@@ u@@ j took the entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al risk here in africa to produce a public good that was pur@@ ch@@ ased by the aid establi@@ sh@@ ment to work with malaria .
we &apos;ve got to start having conver@@ sa@@ tions like this , and i don &apos;t think there &apos;s any better way to start than using the market , but also to bring other people to the table around it .
this is the opening frame of the video that we created .
we used all of that , including a giant hole in the floor that we actually des@@ cen@@ ded the camera and c@@ amer@@ a@@ man through .
and we learned that small stuff st@@ in@@ ks .
so it &apos;s important to remember that whether it &apos;s good or it &apos;s bad , &quot; this too shall pass . &quot;
well , this time , we focused on trying to re@@ constru@@ ct the way the hall of the 500 was before the re@@ mod@@ el@@ ing , and the so@@ -@@ called sal@@ a gran@@ de , which was built in 14@@ 9@@ 4 , and to find out the original do@@ ors , windows , and in order to do that , we first created a 3d model , and then , with ther@@ mo@@ graph@@ y , we went on to discover hidden windows . these are the original windows of the hall of the sal@@ a gran@@ de . we also found out about the hei@@ ght of the cei@@ ling , and we managed to re@@ constru@@ ct , therefore , all the la@@ y@@ out of this original hall the way it was before there came vas@@ ar@@ i , and re@@ struc@@ tured the whole thing , including a sta@@ ir@@ case that was very important in order to pre@@ cis@@ ely place &quot; the battle of ang@@ hi@@ ar@@ i &quot; on a specific area of one of the two walls .
this was an epi@@ ph@@ any . we came to understand and to prove that the brown co@@ ating that we see today was not done by leon@@ ardo da vin@@ c@@ i , which left us only the other drawing that for five cent@@ u@@ ries we were not able to see , so thanks only to technology .
you go from drug for@@ mu@@ lation , lab testing , animal testing , and then clinical trials , which you might call human testing , before the drugs get to market .
this is another example of pati@@ ent@@ -@@ specific stem cells that were engine@@ ered from someone with re@@ tin@@ i@@ tis pig@@ ment@@ o@@ sa .
well , it &apos;s the era of a lot of different things that we &apos;re in right now . but one thing for sure : it &apos;s the era of change . there &apos;s more change going on than ever has occur@@ red in the history of human life on earth .
our school systems are very fla@@ wed and do not reward you for the things that are important in life or for the survival of civilization ; they reward you for a lot of learning and s@@ opp@@ ing up stuff .
paul ma@@ c@@ cre@@ ad@@ y : if we could have the second video , the one-@@ minute , put in as quickly as you can , which -- this will show the path@@ fin@@ der airplane in some fli@@ ghts this past year in ha@@ wa@@ ii , and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it after it had just flo@@ wn to 7@@ 1,@@ 5@@ 30 feet -- higher than any prop@@ eller airplane has ever flo@@ wn .
pm : the video worked right for the first few and i don &apos;t know why it -- there it goes .
over billions of years on a unique sphere , chance has pain@@ ted a thin co@@ vering of life -- complex , im@@ prob@@ able , wonderful and fra@@ gi@@ le . suddenly , we humans -- a recently arrived species , no longer subject to the che@@ cks and bal@@ an@@ ces in@@ her@@ ent in nature -- have grown in population , technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power . we now wi@@ el@@ d the paint@@ br@@ ush .
so i think that , as a symbol , it &apos;s important .
i wasn &apos;t trying to be funny .
they keep going on forever .
e@@ ul@@ er discovered at the time the world &apos;s biggest prime : - 1 .
he ad@@ mit@@ ted after@@ wards it wasn &apos;t that hard to do .
they found another me@@ g@@ ap@@ ri@@ me . &quot;
my laptop at home was looking through four potential can@@ di@@ date pri@@ mes myself as part of a net@@ worked computer h@@ unt around the world for these large numbers .
no , it wasn &apos;t . the high@@ light of 20@@ 12 , so clearly , was the discovery of the hig@@ gs bo@@ son .
the tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil is pre@@ domin@@ antly a sc@@ a@@ ven@@ ger , and it uses its powerful ja@@ ws and its shar@@ p teeth to ch@@ om@@ p on the b@@ ones of ro@@ tting dead animals .
they were too young to survive without their mother .
the next slide is going to be gr@@ u@@ es@@ ome .
but if this can happen in tas@@ mani@@ an de@@ vil@@ s , why hasn &apos;t it happened in other animals or even humans ?
what this tells us , eth@@ ical issues asi@@ de , is that ...
so it turns out that optimi@@ sts are not less likely to di@@ vor@@ ce , but they are more likely to re@@ mar@@ ry .
how honest are you ?
so when they failed it was because they were du@@ m@@ b , and when they succe@@ e@@ ded it was because the ex@@ am just happened to be really easy .
they &apos;re actually more reali@@ stic than healthy individuals .
the average li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood is only 30 percent , &quot; the next time around they would say , &quot; well maybe my li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood is about 35 percent . &quot;
could we alter people &apos;s optimis@@ m bi@@ as by inter@@ fer@@ ing with the brain activity in these regi@@ ons ?
and by the way , when i asked him about his own li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of di@@ vor@@ ce , he said he was quite sure it was zero percent .
and i want to tell you about them each separ@@ ately and then how they interact and why , in the end , there may be some good news .
some of that &apos;s good : ox@@ fa@@ m , a great non-@@ govern@@ mental actor .
and the current narra@@ tive is all about the rise of china and the dec@@ line of the united states .
china still has large areas of under@@ development and per capit@@ a income is a better measure of the sophistic@@ ation of the economy .
it &apos;s bad history .
it &apos;s one in which we can all gain .
the record on post-@@ conflict re@@ co@@ very is not very impres@@ sive .
the politics become easier as the decade pro@@ gr@@ esses if you &apos;re building on a foundation of security and economic development -- the re@@ building of pro@@ sper@@ ity .
there are no quick processes in economics except dec@@ line .
and that is to focus on a few critical obje@@ c@@ tives .
but getting the private sector to exp@@ and is also difficult , because any activity which is open to international trade is basically going to be un@@ competi@@ tive in a post-@@ conflict situation .
and so what i &apos;d suggest is what i call independent service auth@@ ori@@ ties .
pa@@ d@@ dy as@@ h@@ down , who was the grand high n@@ ab@@ ob of bo@@ s@@ nia to the united nations , in his book about his experience , he said , &quot; i realize what i needed was accoun@@ tan@@ ts without bor@@ ders , to follow that money . &quot;
this talk is about being prepared for , and resili@@ ent to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home , the earth .
and around the world , satelli@@ tes and war@@ ning systems are saving lives in f@@ loo@@ d-@@ pr@@ one areas such as banglades@@ h .
infrastructure is going to be affected .
the larger point i &apos;m trying to make is this .
t : i don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
t : i want to change my life !
indeed , if you sc@@ ore the people a century ago against modern nor@@ ms , they would have an average i@@ .@@ q@@ . of 70 .
he talked to the head man of a person in rural russi@@ a .
if a wise person came from the north pole and told me the be@@ ars were white , i might believe him , but every bear that i have seen is a brown bear . &quot;
we are educ@@ ating people to take the hypo@@ the@@ tical seriously , to use abstra@@ ctions , and to link them logi@@ cally .
i &apos;m pri@@ mar@@ ily a moral philosop@@ her .
you state them as abstra@@ ctions and you use lo@@ gic on them .
now , i should say one thing that &apos;s very dis@@ hear@@ ten@@ ing .
it &apos;s a true feeling .
so i got a degree and it turned out to be education .
now it &apos;s still in de@@ bt , but chris has managed , through his own sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce , to get this film out .
i am one of her teaching gest@@ ures .
there &apos;s a prime minister , secre@@ t@@ ary of state , minister of defen@@ se and a c@@ f@@ o , or comp@@ tro@@ ll@@ er .
boy : the world peace game is serious .
and that neighb@@ or was un@@ able to condu@@ ct any military oper@@ ations because their fuel supply was lo@@ cked up .
and so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually , at ag@@ nor@@ -@@ hurt school in al@@ be@@ mar@@ le coun@@ ty -- and one of our military com@@ man@@ ders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; mr . h@@ unter , let &apos;s ask -- there &apos;s a par@@ ent over there . &quot;
we have a lot of data , but i think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
the parents were looking in the window .
it was a political fer@@ ment , so to say -- students out in the streets of paris , revol@@ ting against auth@@ ority .
so i just bought one spec@@ im@@ en of everything which was sold on the ro@@ ad@@ side .
ordinary people know about this because if you go to a village in india , they might not have gone to engineering college , but no one makes a roof placed like this .
children want to make things . children want to do things .
you see insects , you see fro@@ gs , sna@@ kes , e@@ a@@ gles , bu@@ tter@@ flies , fro@@ gs , sna@@ kes , e@@ a@@ gles .
what we &apos;ve done , we &apos;ve just se@@ aled both the ends with ta@@ pe , ni@@ pped the right corner and the bottom left corner , so there &apos;s holes in the opposite cor@@ ners , there &apos;s a little hole over here .
look , this is the te@@ tra@@ pa@@ k -- awful materials from the point of view of the environment .
there &apos;s a factory out there making our children blind , not able to provide them with food , not able to provide them with vi@@ tam@@ in a .
and you can see , this is a little fanta@@ il bird .
and there &apos;s a third one over here .
you could look at nature as being like a cat@@ alo@@ g of products , and all of those have benef@@ ited from a 3.@@ 8@@ -@@ billi@@ on-@@ year research and development period .
there &apos;s a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool .
we &apos;d have a water treatment system tre@@ ating wa@@ ste@@ water , turning that into fresh water and gener@@ ating energy from the soli@@ ds using just plants and micro@@ -@@ organisms .
and the effect of this is that as the dro@@ ple@@ ts start to form on the bu@@ mp@@ s , they stay in ti@@ ght , sp@@ her@@ ical be@@ ads , which means they &apos;re much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole be@@ et@@ le &apos;s sh@@ ell .
we &apos;ll be able to make use of all that to ev@@ apo@@ rate more se@@ a@@ water and en@@ h@@ ance the re@@ stor@@ ative benefits .
really the sahar@@ a forest project is a model for how we could create zer@@ o-@@ carbon food , ab@@ und@@ ant rene@@ w@@ able energy in some of the most wat@@ er-@@ st@@ ressed parts of the planet as well as rever@@ sing deser@@ ti@@ fication in certain areas .
i also have a very ti@@ ght-@@ kn@@ it family , and i &apos;m very , very close with my sister , and as a result , i wanted to have the same type of family when i grew up .
so in my case , i thought , well , will data and an algorith@@ m lead me to my prin@@ ce char@@ ming ?
so need@@ less to say , i was not having a good night .
i wanted somebody was je@@ w ... ish , so i was looking for somebody who had the same background and thoughts on our culture , but wasn &apos;t going to force me to go to shu@@ l every fri@@ day and satur@@ day .
she said she was a &quot; fun girl who is happy and out@@ going . &quot;
so this is a word cloud high@@ ligh@@ ting the most popular words that were used by the most popular women , words like &quot; fun &quot; and &quot; girl &quot; and &quot; love . &quot;
three weeks later , we met up in person for what turned out to be a 14@@ -@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ long conversation that went from coffee shop to restaurant to another coffee shop to another restaurant , and when he dro@@ pped me back off at my house that night i re-@@ sc@@ ored him -- &#91; 1,@@ 0@@ 50 points ! &#93; -- thought , you know what , this entire time i haven &apos;t been pi@@ cky enough .
so what we are asking in the lab is , how can we le@@ verage that power ?
the first way is that they &apos;re actually able to resol@@ ve small detail in the context of clu@@ tter , and though that means being able to read the fine print on a pres@@ cri@@ ption rather than using magni@@ fi@@ er glas@@ ses , you can actually do it with just your e@@ y@@ es@@ ight .
in the lab , we get people to come to the lab , sit in front of a computer screen , and we give them little tas@@ ks that i &apos;m going to get you to do again .
now i &apos;d like you to remember that result , and put it in the context of another group of technology users , a group which is actually much re@@ vered by society , which are people that engage in multi@@ medi@@ a-@@ tas@@ king .
so that &apos;s really the cru@@ x of the research , and to do that , we need to go one more step .
none of you . and you probably have had that feeling , right , pi@@ cking up an education game and sort of feeling , h@@ mm , you know , it &apos;s not really fun , it &apos;s not really eng@@ aging . so what we need is really a new brand of cho@@ col@@ ate , a brand of cho@@ col@@ ate that is ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble , that you really want to play , but that has all the ingre@@ di@@ ents , the good ingre@@ di@@ ents that are extra@@ cted from the bro@@ c@@ col@@ i that you can &apos;t recognize but are still working on your brains . and we &apos;re working on it , but it takes brain scientists to come and to get together , people that work in the enter@@ tainment software industry , and publi@@ s@@ her@@ s , so these are not people that usually meet every day , but it &apos;s actually do@@ able , and we are on the right track .
now we get another result , still very simple .
it &apos;s connected to , what i call , the principle of compu@@ ta@@ tional equi@@ val@@ ence , which tells us that even incredibly simple systems can do compu@@ tations as sophisticated as anything .
let &apos;s say the re@@ venue of microsoft .
right now , if we look at web qu@@ er@@ ies , more than 80 percent of them get hand@@ led success@@ fully the first time .
but actually i think the most exciting thing about this is that it really gives one the chance to democra@@ ti@@ ze progra@@ mming .
so could that be what &apos;s going on with our whole universe ?
from the foun@@ da@@ tions of science to the limit@@ s of technology to the very definition of the human condition , i think compu@@ tation is dest@@ ined to be the defin@@ ing idea of our future .
this is the most de@@ va@@ stat@@ ing epidemic of our time .
so , with one micro@@ flu@@ idi@@ c chip , which is the size of an iphone , you can actually diagno@@ se 100 patients at the same time .
i did everything that i needed to do to become a perfect wife .
this was the cro@@ ss@@ road .
it &apos;s something that so many girls -- i &apos;m lucky , i never died -- but many die .
i got a sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship but i needed to get myself here .
and as we speak right now , three million girls in africa are at risk of going through this mu@@ ti@@ lation .
angel@@ ine had been moving from one place -- because she &apos;s an or@@ ph@@ an , she has no mother , she has no father -- moving from one grandmother &apos;s house to another one , from a@@ un@@ ties to a@@ un@@ ties . she had no st@@ ability in her life .
move out , because as you change your world , as you change your community , as we believe that we are im@@ pac@@ ting one girl , one family , one village , one country at a time .
in fact , let &apos;s go back and look at what caused this crisis , because the consumer , all of us , in our daily lives , actually contribu@@ ted a large part to the problem .
also , remark@@ ably , in the fourth quar@@ ter , spending dro@@ pped to its lo@@ west level in 6@@ 2 years , almost a 3.@@ 7 percent dec@@ line .
based on y &amp; amp ; r &apos;s br@@ and@@ as@@ set valu@@ ator , pro@@ pri@@ et@@ ary tool of v@@ m@@ l and young &amp; amp ; ru@@ bi@@ c@@ am , we set out to understand what &apos;s been happening in the crisis with the consumer market@@ place .
they &apos;ve just institu@@ ted dynamic pri@@ cing .
also a really interesting company is gor@@ e-@@ tex .
perfect example of that is pat@@ ag@@ on@@ ia .
then we also look at the idea of co@@ w-@@ po@@ ol@@ ing , which is the whole phenomenon of consum@@ ers organi@@ zing together to buy meat from organic far@@ ms that they know is safe and controlled in the way that they want it to be controlled .
you see this ris@@ ing force in sort of total transpar@@ ency and open@@ ness that companies are starting to adop@@ t , all because the consumer is dem@@ anding it .
so my question is , why don &apos;t we ask for the things that we need ?
i want you to true your whe@@ els : be honest about the pra@@ ise that you need to hear .
now in the early 197@@ 0s , in ank@@ ar@@ a , that was a bit unusual .
ir@@ on@@ ically , &#91; living in &#93; communities of the li@@ ke@@ -@@ min@@ ded is one of the greatest dan@@ gers of today &apos;s glob@@ alized world .
the child who repres@@ ented it was mo@@ cked , ridi@@ cul@@ ed and bu@@ lli@@ ed end@@ less@@ ly .
i love writing in tur@@ k@@ ish , which to me is very poe@@ tic and very emotional , and i love writing in english , which to me is very mathematical and cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l .
he was looking for a tur@@ k@@ ish woman in the book because i happened to be one .
my mi@@ cr@@ o story became a ma@@ cr@@ o issue when i was pro@@ se@@ cu@@ ted .
liter@@ ature has to take us beyond .
i might write about a musli@@ m woman in one no@@ vel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in my next book , i might write about a hand@@ some , gay professor in nor@@ way .
it &apos;s how you re@@ mix . you take exi@@ sting son@@ gs , you cho@@ p them up , you transform the pieces , you com@@ bine them back together again , and you &apos;ve got a new song , but that new song is clearly com@@ pris@@ ed of old son@@ gs .
gu@@ thr@@ ie adap@@ ted it into &quot; this land is your land . &quot;
it &apos;s the small parts of it that are , and it &apos;s in these small details where we can clearly see patent law con@@ tradi@@ cting its in@@ tent : to pro@@ mote the progress of useful arts .
is this pro@@ mot@@ ing the progress of useful arts ?
and they say , &quot; well , streets don &apos;t have names .
&quot; there &apos;s a fli@@ p side to everything , &quot; the saying goes , and in 2 minutes , derek si@@ vers shows this is true in a few ways you might not expect .
so that big s@@ wee@@ ping , white sphere in the corner is saturn , which is actually in the background of the picture .
so what you &apos;re looking at is the surface of the moon europa , which is a th@@ ick she@@ et of ice , probably a hundred kilometers th@@ ick .
so explor@@ ation can pay for itself .
in &quot; wonder@@ s of the solar system , &quot; we kept em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zing the laws of physics are universal .
now , there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the big bang .
the vo@@ y@@ ager is a tiny machine .
just explo@@ it it ; just build things . &quot;
so let me ex@@ pose this l@@ ur@@ king industry a little bit further .
this is nothing . i am being stal@@ ked across the web .
g@@ ary ko@@ vac@@ s : tracking our online tra@@ ck@@ ers
and i &apos;d say , &quot; well , i &apos;m walking for the environment . &quot;
so on this first day i actually listen@@ ed .
there are two stories in mon@@ tan@@ a .
&quot; yes , you can clear cut ... &quot;
and it &apos;s one of those things that came out of the sil@@ ence , the listening to each other .
and i got in my sa@@ il@@ boat , sa@@ iled all the way through the car@@ ib@@ be@@ an -- it wasn &apos;t really my sa@@ il@@ boat , i kind of worked on that boat -- got to ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela and i started walking .
i was so used to that person that i didn &apos;t want to stop .
for a hun@@ gry child , politics and freedom are not even thought of .
i mean the kind of hope that made me believe that the next tr@@ ash can had bread , even though it usually didn &apos;t .
and i remember i f@@ ought in school more than once a day .
you have to choose to believe in hope .
j@@ k : okay , i &apos;m not going to make it any longer in kore@@ an because i don &apos;t think i can make it without te@@ aring up .
so it &apos;s very useful .
but i must say they are no longer natural dis@@ ast@@ ers .
after a fire , what are you pro@@ pos@@ ing ? &quot;
and in 2008 , in ch@@ eng@@ du , sich@@ u@@ an area in china , nearly 7@@ 0,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destro@@ yed because of the corruption between the auth@@ ority and the contra@@ ctor .
finally i met a very nice ma@@ yo@@ r in on@@ aga@@ wa village in mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i .
i write books and magazine artic@@ les .
a study published last year found that from birth , from the moment of birth , babies cry in the ac@@ cent of their mother &apos;s na@@ tive language .
they make up a mix of influ@@ ences as individual and i@@ dio@@ syn@@ cra@@ tic as the woman her@@ self .
why would under@@ nutri@@ tion in the wom@@ b result in disease later ?
in other words , the mothers with post-@@ trau@@ matic stress syndro@@ me had passed on a vulner@@ ability to the condition to their children while they were still in u@@ ter@@ o .
it was the po@@ et sam@@ u@@ el ta@@ yl@@ or col@@ eri@@ dge who first suggest@@ ed this re@@ cep@@ tive state of mind .
he said that ma@@ gi@@ cians deli@@ ber@@ ately explo@@ it the way their audi@@ ences think .
our stories make us the people we are and , sometimes , the people we want to be .
so there seems to be a strange dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ality at work , i think , in many areas of human problem solving , particularly those which invol@@ ve human psych@@ ology , which is : the tenden@@ cy of the organization or the institution is to de@@ plo@@ y as much force as possible , as much comp@@ ul@@ sion as possible , whereas actually , the tenden@@ cy of the person is to be almost influ@@ enced in absolute rever@@ se propor@@ tion to the amount of force being applied .
my guess is that the cost of inst@@ all@@ ing this in the li@@ ft in the ly@@ d@@ ma@@ r hotel in stock@@ hol@@ m is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds ma@@ x .
i spoke about this before , and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said , &quot; okay , what can you do ? &quot;
and there &apos;s to some ex@@ tent a big strategy my@@ th that &apos;s pre@@ valent in business now .
we don &apos;t know what to call it .
i hope to arri@@ ve at new terri@@ tor@@ ies to discover sounds i have never heard before .
for the second dem@@ o , i have this wi@@ i remote that &apos;s actually next to the tv .
and also , it was kind of interesting that god needed help .
the cost of a c@@ up of coffee can save a child &apos;s life , right .
it was an amazing sort of insi@@ ght for me .
so what i did hear , once in a while , was that people wanted a lo@@ an -- i thought that so@@ unded very reas@@ on@@ able and really exciting .
so what i hope is that , not only can the money keep flo@@ wing forth through ki@@ va -- that &apos;s a very positive and meaning@@ ful thing -- but i hope ki@@ va can blu@@ r those lines , like i said , between the traditional rich and poor categ@@ ories that we &apos;re taught to see in the world , this fal@@ se di@@ ch@@ ot@@ om@@ y of us and them , have and have not .
and then third , from what i &apos;ve heard from the entreprene@@ urs i &apos;ve gotten to know , when all else is equal , given the option to have just money to do what you need to do , or money plus the support and encoura@@ gement of a global community , people choose the community plus the money .
so they can be a c@@ ash , or a cause , invest@@ or .
j@@ essi@@ ca j@@ ack@@ ley : poverty , money -- and love
under extreme conditions , general rela@@ tivity and quant@@ um theory allow time to be@@ have like another dimension of space .
this brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race .
ste@@ phen ha@@ w@@ king : questi@@ oning the universe
is e@@ .@@ t@@ . out there ?
this is the allen telescop@@ e ar@@ ray electr@@ on@@ ics today .
okay , now i &apos;ve given you a lot of numbers here , but they &apos;re mostly big numbers , okay , so , you know , keep that in mind . there &apos;s pl@@ ent@@ y of real e@@ state , pl@@ ent@@ y of real e@@ state in the universe , and if we &apos;re the only bit of real e@@ state in which there &apos;s some interesting occu@@ pants , that makes you a mira@@ cle , and i know you like to think you &apos;re a mira@@ cle , but if you do science , you learn rather quickly that every time you think you &apos;re a mira@@ cle , you &apos;re wrong , so probably not the case .
they &apos;re going to be ahead of us , maybe by a few thousand years , maybe by a few millions years , but substan@@ tially ahead of us , and that means , if you can understand anything that they &apos;re going to say , then you might be able to shor@@ t-@@ circu@@ it history by getting information from a society that &apos;s way beyond our own .
well , that would be interesting if it was true , and job security for me , but i don &apos;t think the evidence is very good . that &apos;s more , you know , sad than significant .
okay , so we &apos;re interested in these sorts of things .
in fact , my last comm@@ ents to these kids , at the end i said , &quot; you know , you kids are smar@@ ter than the people i work with . &quot; now — they didn &apos;t even care about that .
we use that name to celebra@@ te peace in the region and in the planet .
when i go to places like this , which are pal@@ e@@ on@@ t@@ ological sites , it &apos;s like going to a game park , an extin@@ ct game park .
here is a clo@@ se@@ -up of the fossil , after five years of cle@@ an@@ ing , prepar@@ ation and descri@@ ption , which was very long , and i had to ex@@ pose the b@@ ones from the sand@@ stone block i just showed you in the previous slide .
so , with all that information , the big question is -- what do we actually -- what does she tell us ?
when we did the analysis of this bone , it was clear that it looked very ch@@ imp@@ -@@ like , chimpanze@@ e-@@ like .
and the key is to pro@@ mote a positive african at@@ titude towards africa .
this is indeed the true heart of the planet .
the sar@@ gas@@ so sea , for example , is not a sea bo@@ unded by co@@ ast@@ lines , but it is bo@@ unded by oce@@ an@@ ic curr@@ ents that con@@ tain and en@@ vel@@ op@@ e this wealth of sar@@ gas@@ sum that gro@@ ws and ag@@ gre@@ gates there .
as such , it does create a challenge to protect , but we also have a challenge prote@@ cting the species that move along with it .
we &apos;ve been reve@@ aling this information through technical work@@ sh@@ ops .
so on this tour , i hope i provi@@ ded you with a new perspective of the high se@@ as : one , that it is our home too , and that we need to work together if we are to make this a sustainable ocean future for us all .
good ! ale@@ x garden says , &quot; to be successful put your nose down in something and get dam@@ n good at it . &quot;
or fail@@ ing that , do the eight things -- and trust me , these are the big eight things that lead to success .
a@@ o : yeah .
many of us have a social media pres@@ ence -- a virtual person@@ ality made up of status up@@ dat@@ es , t@@ wee@@ ts and connections , stor@@ ed in the cloud . adam o@@ stro@@ w as@@ ks a big question : what happens to that person@@ ality after you &apos;ve died ? could it ... live on ?
and importantly , it &apos;s a rich source of vi@@ tam@@ in b@@ 12 .
now i &apos;m an econom@@ ist , i &apos;m not a doctor , but i see the god complex around me all the time in my fellow econom@@ ists .
five thousand products -- imagine coun@@ ting every product categ@@ ory in c@@ es@@ ar hi@@ d@@ al@@ go &apos;s data .
now you show me a successful complex system , and i will show you a system that has evolved through trial and er@@ ror .
you find yourself a mathemati@@ cian ; you find yourself a physi@@ c@@ ist -- somebody who under@@ stands the dynam@@ ics of this flu@@ id .
and eventually , they &apos;ll have evolved to such a high peak of perfe@@ ction that they will make us all their pe@@ ts -- if , of course , they haven &apos;t already done so .
we &apos;ll get rid of the ones that don &apos;t . &quot; -- when a politi@@ cian campaig@@ ns on that platform , and more importantly , when vot@@ ers like you and me are willing to vote for that kind of politi@@ cian , then i will ad@@ mit that it is obvious that trial and er@@ ror works , and that -- thank you .
arch@@ ie lets it die down .
his friend , gor@@ o shi@@ mur@@ a -- who worked on the mathematics with him -- many decades later , refle@@ cted on tan@@ i@@ y@@ ama &apos;s life .
but that &apos;s not possible , you might think .
in response , some people argue , but we need growth , we need it to solve poverty .
the story on food , on water , on soil , on climate is all much the same .
imagine our economy when the carbon bubble bur@@ sts , when the financial markets recognize that , to have any hope of pre@@ vent@@ ing the climate spir@@ aling out of control , the oil and coal industri@@ es are finished .
you see , those people that have faith that humans can solve any problem , that technology is limit@@ less , that markets can be a force for good , are in fact right .
when we think about the future i paint , of course we should feel a bit of fear .
but of course what we have to remember is this .
and then by 2007 it was 6@@ 8 percent .
and the reason we have to do that in the short term is because we have just run out of c@@ ash .
because that &apos;s the con@@ sequence of not dealing with this stuff .
so , cells have this cycle .
it &apos;s almost like leaving con@@ gress .
and this is becoming common , it &apos;s moving very quickly , it &apos;s moving in a whole series of places .
and now you have co@@ ch@@ le@@ ar im@@ plants that go into people &apos;s heads and allow the dea@@ f to begin to hear .
maybe not .
and she thought to her@@ self , &quot; my child just turned two , and until the child turned two , i had always used this complicated , expensive cure , you know , this treatment .
and then , finally talk a little bit about a third way , about another technology , which is probably better than anything we have , but which -- there hasn &apos;t been any enth@@ usi@@ as@@ m for ad@@ option pre@@ cis@@ ely because people are so en@@ am@@ ored with the current car seat solution . ok .
but when you look at other types of cr@@ as@@ hes , like re@@ ar-@@ impact cr@@ as@@ hes , indeed , the car se@@ ats don &apos;t per@@ form as well .
does he not look content , ready to go , like he could survive anything ? and then , if you look at the kid in back , it looks like he &apos;s already cho@@ king before the crash even happens .
so that kid would do fine in the crash .
they were almost impossible to s@@ wal@@ low .
so all of the things that we &apos;ve seen come about , starting , say , with satelli@@ te images of the whole earth , which we couldn &apos;t even imagine happening before , all these things roll@@ ing into our lives , just this ab@@ und@@ ance of things that are right before us , sitting in front of our laptop , or our des@@ k@@ top .
and there &apos;s almost no other machine that we &apos;ve ever made that runs the number of hours , the number of days .
because in fact , that &apos;s how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the web works .
right now , phones don &apos;t go through the web , but they are beginning to , and they will .
attention is the cur@@ ren@@ cy .
i &apos;m calling it the one machine . but we &apos;re lin@@ king data .
so you have to be open to having your data shared , which is a much bigger step than just sharing your web page , or your computer .
just like it wasn &apos;t tv and only better .
i appreci@@ ate your time .
and that was , &quot; how did this happen to me ? &quot;
what happens is that cir@@ cular lo@@ gic takes over .
i kind of er@@ ased everything in my brain to follow that .
and i &apos;ve had for 30 years an interest in a series of comple@@ xi@@ ties where a series of forces are brought to bear , and to understand the nature of the final result of that , repres@@ enting the building itself .
in this case , we only used 15 of the 60 ac@@ r@@ es of land , and the 45 ac@@ r@@ es was a park and would become the leg@@ acy of the olymp@@ ic village .
and as it moves , it takes pieces of the earth with it . it ben@@ ds up .
10 of these -- it &apos;s just under a million square feet -- 800 and some thousand square feet -- 10 of these would power s@@ aus@@ ali@@ to -- the del@@ ta on this .
and the second project that was just finished in los angeles that uses some of the same ideas . it uses landscape as a major idea .
and finally , one of the most interesting projects -- it &apos;s a cour@@ thou@@ se .
so let &apos;s make a little test .
because brains are expensive .
so because of having coo@@ ked food , it &apos;s easier to di@@ gest .
i use the eu@@ p@@ he@@ mis@@ m di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve comfort -- actually -- it &apos;s a di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve dis@@ comfort , which the gut is concerned with .
it senses it by chemical means and very importantly by mechan@@ ical means , because it has to move the food -- it has to mix all the various elements which we need for di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on .
so now back to the cooking question and back to the design .
for a time , we shared the stage with our dist@@ ant cou@@ s@@ ins , ne@@ anderth@@ al , who clearly had some spar@@ k of awareness , but -- whether it was the increase in the size of the brain , or the development of language , or some other evolutionary cat@@ aly@@ st -- we quickly left ne@@ anderth@@ al gas@@ ping for survival .
all peop@@ les are simply cultural op@@ tions , different visi@@ ons of life itself .
it means things happen .
it &apos;s kind of like an an@@ de@@ an wo@@ od@@ stock : 6@@ 0,000 indi@@ ans on pil@@ gri@@ ma@@ ge to the end of a di@@ rt road that leads to the sac@@ red valley , called the sin@@ ak@@ ar@@ a , which is domin@@ ated by three ton@@ gues of the great gl@@ ac@@ ier .
and i always wanted to go back into these mountains , to see if this could possibly be true , as indeed had been repor@@ ted by the great anthropo@@ log@@ ist , reich@@ el-@@ dol@@ ma@@ to@@ ff .
and this man sitting cros@@ s-@@ leg@@ ged is now a grow@@ n-@@ up eu@@ geni@@ o , a man who i &apos;ve known since 197@@ 4 .
a people who find a way , with their imagination , to car@@ ve life out of that very fro@@ zen .
in every case , these are dynamic , living peop@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces .
you &apos;ll find it inside of you .
but these materials are grown from agri@@ cultural by@@ products , not pe@@ tro@@ le@@ um .
this matri@@ x self-@@ assem@@ bles , growing through and around the particles , making millions and millions of tiny fi@@ bers .
thank you .
for example , if you sh@@ ine light through a super@@ flu@@ id , it is able to slow phot@@ ons down to 60 kilometers per hour .
they do it by changing their shape .
many will turn to drug ab@@ use and pro@@ stit@@ ution , and that will ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably lower property values in urban neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
and it &apos;s a wonderful setting , as i hope you &apos;ll find , and a great ic@@ on to the best of the vic@@ tor@@ ian tradition .
that is my first love , and that &apos;s what i &apos;ll tell you a little bit about .
either they &apos;re the same , or this one &apos;s bigger than this one , or this one &apos;s bigger than that one .
you &apos;re waiting with b@@ ated breath for the final to@@ ss .
that &apos;s a rather tri@@ vi@@ al connection between prob@@ ability and gene@@ tics .
let &apos;s suppose there &apos;s a test for hiv -- the virus that causes aids -- and the test says the person has the disease .
here &apos;s the key intuition .
when you multi@@ p@@ ly 8@@ ,@@ 500 together twice , you get about 7@@ 3 million . &quot;
and we certainly should think in the context of a crimin@@ al trial that that &apos;s un@@ likely , because of the pres@@ um@@ ption of inno@@ c@@ ence .
to go back to the legal context , at the s@@ ally c@@ lar@@ k trial all of the law@@ yers just accep@@ ted what the exper@@ t said .
every year in the usa , over 20@@ ,000 are killed or in@@ ju@@ red with 3@@ 50,000 home fir@@ es .
this invention will reduce global energy consumption by allo@@ wing remote control and auto@@ ma@@ tion of every out@@ let in every home and business .
the four countries have no access to facebook .
the chinese government blo@@ cked every single international web 2.@@ 0 service , and we chinese copy@@ cat every one .
right after the train crash , auth@@ ori@@ ties literally wanted to cover up the train , bur@@ y the train .
it even has its own name , with weib@@ o .
chinese people start to learn how to negoti@@ ate and talk to people .
the story about the train crash , maybe the question is not about why 10 million cri@@ tic@@ is@@ ms in five days , but why the chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online .
but it didn &apos;t change the chinese political system , and also the chinese central government u@@ tili@@ zed this cent@@ r@@ alized ser@@ ver structure to streng@@ then its power to coun@@ ter the local government and the different fac@@ tions .
many of you know that he was dea@@ f , or near pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly dea@@ f , when he wrote that .
charles lim@@ b : now despite everything going for this child in terms of family support and simple inf@@ used learning , there is a limit@@ ation to what a child who &apos;s dea@@ f , an inf@@ ant who was born dea@@ f , has in this world in terms of social , edu@@ cational , vo@@ cational opportunities .
j@@ n : yeah .
there &apos;s really very little point in listening to music when it doesn &apos;t sound good to you .
and the second one .
because his gra@@ ve was ex@@ hum@@ ed .
and it was absolutely wonderful .
charles lim@@ b : building the musical muscle
it means the ne@@ ther@@ lands is a pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful country .
it was our last res@@ ort .
now this may sound con@@ tradi@@ c@@ tory to you .
and when there is mu@@ tual gain , both sides stand to lose more than they would gain if they started a war .
i hope you will support the eff@@ or@@ ts of our ar@@ med forces to train soldiers like this young cap@@ tain and provide her with a good gun , instead of the bad gun my father was given .
and so , i &apos;m here to tell you , you don &apos;t need a computer to actually have a sp@@ ell . in fact , what you can do at the molecular level is that if you en@@ code information -- you en@@ code a sp@@ ell or program as molecules -- then physics can actually directly interpre@@ t that information and run a program . that &apos;s what happens in proteins .
you get really nice 1@@ 30 nan@@ ome@@ ter tri@@ an@@ gles . if you do it again , you can get arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary patterns . so on a rec@@ tan@@ gle you can paint patterns of north and south america , or the words , &quot; dna . &quot;
there is about 1,000 feet of air below him .
rule number eight : strength doesn &apos;t always equal success .
the world bank projects by 20@@ 11 , it will be under 20 million , which is a redu@@ ction of 95 percent .
most of the project was done in the last few years of the project .
so , i took 15 different li@@ sts from key thin@@ kers , like the en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia britan@@ ni@@ ca , the museum of natural history , car@@ l sa@@ gan &apos;s co@@ s@@ mic cal@@ end@@ ar on the same -- and these people were not trying to make my point ; these were just li@@ sts in re@@ ference works , and i think that &apos;s what they thought the key events were in biological evolution and technologi@@ cal evolution .
process@@ or performance on in@@ tel chi@@ ps , the average price of a transi@@ st@@ or -- 196@@ 8 , you could buy one transi@@ st@@ or for a dollar .
and this is a very wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad phenomen@@ a .
the internet has been dou@@ bling in power and continu@@ es to , measu@@ red many different ways .
where will we get the software ?
i mean , we will have two-@@ to-@@ the-@@ 2@@ 5@@ th-@@ power greater price performance , capacity and band@@ wid@@ th of these technologies , which is pretty phenomen@@ al .
they both em@@ power our promise and our per@@ il .
belief is natural ; dis@@ belief , skep@@ tic@@ ism , science , is not natural .
you &apos;re more cau@@ ti@@ ous . you &apos;re more vi@@ gil@@ ant .
what do you see here ?
bru@@ g@@ ger and his collea@@ gue , christ@@ ine mo@@ hr , gave subje@@ cts l-@@ dop@@ a .
and if you go too far on that , that &apos;s just simply lab@@ el@@ ed as ma@@ dness .
the impossible cra@@ te illusion .
and there &apos;s two types of cells that do this , that record fac@@ ial fe@@ atures either glob@@ ally , or specifically these large , rapi@@ d-@@ fir@@ ing cells , first look at the general face .
but of course , lincol@@ n was as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ated by a con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy .
it ties together all this into the power of expec@@ tation and the power of belief .
michael s@@ her@@ mer : thank you very much . thank you . thanks .
still exists back home .
i mean , here , too , one of our part@@ ners was at van j@@ ones and the books not b@@ ars project -- they have managed , with their foot@@ age in california to change the you@@ th cor@@ rec@@ tion systems emplo@@ yed , and it &apos;s much -- much -- i think , more human@@ e metho@@ ds are being looked at , how you should lock up young kids , and that &apos;s questi@@ on@@ able to start off .
they are grown completely in a ball of dung .
and what do you think they could be looking at as they clim@@ b on top of the ball ?
he does a little dance , he turns around , and heads back in this . he knows exactly where he &apos;s going .
and what we did then was put little bo@@ ots on these legs , because this was a way to test if the legs were involved in sen@@ sing the temperature of the soil .
it knows the be@@ aring home , and it knows it should be in that direction .
my passi@@ ons are music , technology and making things .
and the sounds you &apos;re hearing came from eight micro@@ phones atta@@ ched to ob@@ stac@@ les around the park , and it sounds like chaos , but actually all the tricks start with a very distin@@ ct sla@@ p , but successful tricks end with a pop , whereas un@@ successful tricks more of a scrat@@ ch and a tu@@ m@@ ble , and tricks on the ra@@ il will ring out like a g@@ ong , and voices occu@@ p@@ y very unique frequ@@ en@@ cies in the sk@@ ate park .
now , we &apos;ve all seen a lot of ted@@ talks online , so let &apos;s watch one now with the sound turned off and the closed cap@@ tion@@ ing turned on .
in 19@@ 24 he was last seen disappe@@ aring into the clou@@ ds near the sum@@ mit of mt . ever@@ est .
i was 26 . i remember sitting there looking down at my sle@@ dge . i had my sk@@ is ready to go , i had a satelli@@ te phone , a pump@@ -@@ action sh@@ ot@@ gun in case i was attac@@ ked by a pol@@ ar bear .
or , &quot; that &apos;s nice . you know , my grandmother &apos;s going on a cru@@ ise to ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a next year . you know .
there are business models , and there are finan@@ ci@@ als , and there are markets and there is that . over@@ all , of all the things that you have to do , what is the single most important thing the v@@ c is going to be invest@@ ing in ?
you &apos;ve got to be able to say , &quot; hey , you know , i &apos;ve done this before . &quot;
that you are going to be here to the end .
that &apos;s it -- that should get you right there .
the up@@ side means that if you &apos;re telling me that you &apos;re going to be out there , five years out , making a million dollars a year -- h@@ mm . that &apos;s not really up@@ side .
yes ? ok , steve jobs .
i know the day , i know who i am , i know you &apos;re pres@@ enting .
i want to know who you &apos;re selling this thing to , in terms of custom@@ ers .
i hope you invest@@ ed personally .
number one : always use pres@@ enter mode , or o@@ vation , or pres@@ enter tools , because it lets you know exactly where you &apos;re going .
and in this case , i quickly found this : the fur@@ th@@ est point from the center of the earth is not the ti@@ p of mo@@ unt ever@@ est , like i might have thought , it &apos;s the ti@@ p of this mountain : mo@@ unt ch@@ im@@ bor@@ a@@ z@@ o in ecu@@ ad@@ or .
there are still do@@ zens and do@@ zens of un@@ cont@@ ac@@ ted tri@@ bes living on this planet .
but as the article men@@ tions , because of enzy@@ me break@@ down , it &apos;s un@@ likely that phen@@ eth@@ y@@ lam@@ ine will reach your brain if taken or@@ ally .
like my next link , the almost ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble link , ham the astro@@ ch@@ im@@ p .
thank you .
why as a result , what happens ?
and we de@@ value it in three areas .
but we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been infe@@ cted by the serious me@@ me for 45 years .
so they &apos;re re@@ stri@@ ctive -- don &apos;t use your mobile phone , don &apos;t use your laptop , don &apos;t search the internet , don &apos;t be on i@@ .@@ m .
be@@ ars play .
it &apos;s been shown to pro@@ mote pre-@@ fron@@ tal cortex development where a lot of cogni@@ tion is happening .
but i have news for you : our thinking is back@@ wards .
people , service , profit .
so some steps that we can take -- to finish up -- how to make this revolution through play .
lunch is like the rec@@ ess for work .
i still have -- or did i use the word still ? i didn &apos;t mean that .
so how can you , without dr@@ ying up , make things with the same pleasure , as a gift to others , for so long ?
and i vis@@ ited it with several ladies , and asked all sorts of questions of the director .
e@@ z : well , if you are sure , i have to tell you that within five minutes i will talk very fast .
i mean , this was -- was i my things ?
i came up with this idea : a life of bits and pieces , which i &apos;m just starting to work on -- my next project .
that &apos;s my view from my window outside of s@@ ant@@ a cru@@ z , in bon@@ ny do@@ on , just 35 miles from here .
i would always be perfectly co@@ i@@ ff@@ ed and well re@@ sted , and in fact , it was not like that at all .
i was over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with love and affe@@ ction for my wife , with deep , deep gra@@ titude that we had what appe@@ ared to be a healthy child .
r@@ g : that is not fair . this is a trick question . he &apos;s not up there , is he ?
so to take one example among many : in southern india there &apos;s a practice known as j@@ hol@@ ab@@ har@@ i , in which the preg@@ nant woman , when she &apos;s seven or eight months preg@@ nant , moves in with her mother and goes through a series of ritu@@ als and cer@@ em@@ on@@ ies , give birth and re@@ turns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born .
in a survey , 7@@ 4 percent of women said that mis@@ car@@ ri@@ age , they felt , was par@@ tly their fau@@ lt , which is awful .
and part of what happens , i think , in your &apos; 20@@ s and &apos; 3@@ 0s , is you start to learn to he@@ dge your happiness .
a@@ v : and we kind of feel that the happiness gap , which we talked about , is really the result of walking into par@@ enting -- and really any long-term partner@@ ship for that matter -- with the wrong expec@@ tations .
and this just didn &apos;t work until we could cross this line that says high-@@ definition .
so i &apos;m going to do this for you right now , what you just heard .
so when you go into the recor@@ ding s@@ ession , you get to stop after every piece and re@@ build the piano if you need to .
and i believe you &apos;ll get to the next step , the real dream of listen@@ ers .
and fortunately , it &apos;s right in here .
but what i want to talk about begins when i was at this city , this university , as a student .
and i think you can see around us now , some of the green sho@@ ots of a very different kind of economy and capit@@ alism which could grow .
the biggest sector , by far , will be health -- already 18 percent of the american economy , predi@@ cted to grow to 30 , even 40 percent by mi@@ d-@@ century .
and they &apos;ve been given new moment@@ um by the crisis , by the need for better answers to job@@ less@@ ness , community break@@ down and so on .
history was over and society would ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably have to take second place to economy .
what i &apos;m here to talk with you about today is an intri@@ gu@@ ing new hypo@@ thesis and some surpris@@ ingly powerful new fin@@ dings that i &apos;ve been working on about the link between the structure of the language you speak and how you find yourself with the pro@@ pen@@ sity to save .
all of this information is ob@@ li@@ g@@ atory . chinese doesn &apos;t let me ignor@@ e it .
if , on the other hand , you speak a fu@@ tur@@ eless language , the present and the future , you speak about them iden@@ tically .
do you happen to know how much your house is worth ? do you mind telling me ?
yes , because i just told you , we actually collect a lot of health data as econom@@ ists .
and i want to talk to you today about language loss and the glob@@ alization of english .
after all , the best education -- according to the lat@@ est world university r@@ ank@@ ings -- is to be found in the universi@@ ties of the u.k. and the u.@@ s .
if you think about the islam@@ ic gol@@ den age , there was lots of trans@@ lation then .
and to do that , they need a western education .
a simple idea , but it could have such far@@ -@@ reach@@ ing consequences .
but fortunately , henry kra@@ mer , who put up the prize for -- that was a one-@@ mile flight -- put up a new prize for flying the english chan@@ nel , 21 miles .
now they are 9@@ 8 percent , and it , i think , shows human dom@@ ination of the earth .
with a w@@ ing@@ sp@@ an of 24@@ 7 feet , this makes her larger than a bo@@ eing 7@@ 4@@ 7 .
a when they got bor@@ ed with their father &apos;s project , they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own .
all right .
so , budd@@ ha &apos;s teaching has lost its moment@@ um .
and there , in the town , he &apos;s approach@@ ed by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries , even in america , i think , in some areas -- and he &apos;s looking just terrible .
he jum@@ ps back and there , of course , is the future budd@@ ha ma@@ it@@ re@@ ya in a beautiful vision -- rain@@ bo@@ w lights , gol@@ den , je@@ wel@@ ed , a pl@@ as@@ ma body , an ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te my@@ stic vision -- that he sees .
the animals are in one of their human lives . the humans are human .
we exp@@ and . we take the feeling about remem@@ ber@@ ing a mama , and we de@@ f@@ use that to all beings in this medi@@ tation .
you want to re@@ pay that kin@@ dness that all beings have shown to you .
and they think of it as somehow mach@@ o , hard discipl@@ ine on themselves .
one thing we mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t think is that compassion makes you mis@@ er@@ able .
why is that important ?
all of these are possibilities .
and it &apos;s like the traffic that you see .
and the answer is , simply , that if i hold up three fing@@ ers , you can count that easily , but if i hold up this , it &apos;s sort of hard to say that i just did seven .
the two blo@@ bs that are light in the middle there are the united states and europe .
so these are the components .
and the second is a design issue , and it &apos;s not directly relevant , but it &apos;s a nice stat@@ ement .
let me just ask you , to start with , this simple question : who invented the mountain bi@@ ke ?
build creative clu@@ sters in cities ; create more r &amp; amp ; d par@@ ks , so on and so forth .
do you go into your board and say , &quot; look , i &apos;ve got a fantastic idea for an em@@ br@@ y@@ onic product in a mar@@ g@@ in@@ al market , with consum@@ ers we &apos;ve never de@@ alt with before , and i &apos;m not sure it &apos;s going to have a big pa@@ yo@@ ff , but it could be really , really big in the future ? &quot;
and it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous .
when i started in journ@@ alism -- financial times , 20 years ago -- it was very , very exciting to see someone reading the newspaper .
new organi@@ za@@ tional models coming about , mix@@ ing closed and open in tri@@ cky ways .
or you can get on a plane , fly to sh@@ ang@@ hai , qu@@ eu@@ e up outside sh@@ anda &apos;s off@@ ices -- cost probably 600 , 700 dollars -- and rec@@ la@@ im your character , get your history back .
it &apos;s pretty incredible -- the video &apos;s online .
this was incredible ; this is what i wanted to do .
i look at this photo , and he seems really interested in what &apos;s going on with that butt@@ on , but it doesn &apos;t seem like he is really that interested in cros@@ sing the street .
sometimes they &apos;re a little bit more abstra@@ ct .
&quot; de@@ ar 4@@ 8 , i promise to listen to you , to fight for you , to respect you always . &quot;
but the idea was that at one point i did a project called facebook me equ@@ als you , where i wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person .
and when you put them together , something ma@@ gical happens , something absolutely incredible happens , and all of a sudden i get a ch@@ or@@ us from around the world .
and how you end up with a psych@@ op@@ ath , and a kil@@ ler , depends on exactly when the damage occur@@ s .
and if i was a young girl , somewhere in a violent area , you know , a 14 year old , and i want to find a mate , i &apos;d find some tough guy , right , to protect me .
because my father himself , and my three un@@ cles , in world war ii , were all con@@ scienti@@ ous obje@@ c@@ tors , all pus@@ sy@@ cat@@ s .
we colli@@ de them inside giant dete@@ c@@ tors .
now , there &apos;s no real reason i &apos;m aware of for that , but that seems to be the case .
you know , they &apos;re a step in size from the entire obser@@ vable universe .
but there &apos;s an extra symbol in this equ@@ ation : h .
if that picture &apos;s true , then we have to discover those hig@@ gs particles at the l@@ h@@ c .
this is a creation story , i think , equ@@ ally as wonderful .
and i think that &apos;s a wonderful and significant story .
using 3d ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und technology , we can now see that developing babies appear to s@@ mile , even in the wom@@ b .
british researchers found that one s@@ mile can generate the same level of brain stimu@@ lation as up to 2,000 b@@ ars of cho@@ col@@ ate .
&quot; but why ? &quot; i asked him .
&quot; well , because the street is sa@@ fer now , &quot; they ans@@ wer@@ ed .
it &apos;s about system , it &apos;s about organization .
our world is defined by the p@@ ace of change .
we were in one of the poor@@ est countries on the planet , but 80 percent of the people had mobile devices in their hands .
9@@ 6 percent of them found it useful .
in mon@@ go@@ li@@ a for instance , where 30 percent of the people are no@@ ma@@ di@@ c , sms information systems are being used to track mi@@ gration and weather patterns .
there are no more reasons not to do it .
but the larger sense that we have of our lives , the slightly more abstra@@ ct one , is indi@@ rect .
this is because time doesn &apos;t flow in the digital world in the same way that it does in the natural one .
there were those with power and water , and those without .
the self that lives in the long narra@@ tive ar@@ c and the self that experiences the moment become one .
as chris said , i grew up in nigeria with a whole generation -- in the &apos; 8@@ 0s -- of students who were prote@@ sting a military dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship , which has finally ended .
i said , &quot; english , m@@ um . &quot;
but the simple act of kin@@ dness from a complete stran@@ ger will un@@ stit@@ ch you . &quot;
my friend bra@@ d k@@ ess@@ ler says that we didn &apos;t become human until we started keeping go@@ ats .
the name was john james , and in those days , if a family member commit@@ ted a crime , the military would hold you as ran@@ so@@ m ti@@ ll your family turned themselves in .
they would kno@@ ck down the s@@ hr@@ ine , and they would stop saying the god &apos;s name .
for some reason it explo@@ des , and you begin to get these things .
the first theory of the case is that &apos;s all she wrote .
but as you &apos;re thinking about this , one of the interesting things is how small these mu@@ tations are and where they take place .
if that is true , it leads to some very complicated questions for the london olymp@@ ics .
here &apos;s a second experiment : if you could photo@@ copy your body , maybe you also want to take your mind .
and we still don &apos;t know why this is happening .
what i think we are doing is we &apos;re transi@@ tion@@ ing as a species .
so it has four ro@@ tors .
so on the left , you see dan@@ iel thro@@ wing this robot up into the air .
so what that effectively does is produ@@ ces a smo@@ oth and gra@@ ce@@ ful motion .
so these ants don &apos;t have any central co@@ ordin@@ ator .
so once you know how to fly in forma@@ tion , you can actually pick up objects co@@ oper@@ a@@ tively .
so this robot is actually being comm@@ and@@ ed re@@ mot@@ ely by frank .
and let me start by telling you , i got@@ ch@@ a .
what &apos;s it gon@@ na look like ? we have huge grand challenges these days of habit@@ at loss . we have more and more people , billions of people , in 100 years , god knows how many people , and how little space there will be to fit all of them , so we need to change the way that we see cities , and looking at this picture on the left of new york city today , you can see how gra@@ y and brown it is .
perhaps there are fewer pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des in the cities than there are in &#91; rural &#93; areas .
we exercise , we eat healthy , we take vi@@ tam@@ ins .
now , this was a myster@@ y in the new york times where the hon@@ ey was very red , and the new york state for@@ en@@ si@@ cs department came in and they actually did some science to match the red dy@@ e with that found in a mar@@ a@@ sch@@ in@@ o cher@@ ry factory down the street .
bread is not only standard in the western diet .
and we have this my@@ th@@ ical image of how life was in rural areas in the past .
well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simpli@@ stic statistics .
so bread has become from a main sta@@ ple , a source of cal@@ ories associated with o@@ bes@@ ity and also a source of moder@@ nity , of modern life .
and the fall@@ acy comes from ide@@ ali@@ zing a past that we have for@@ gotten about .
so what can we do ?
we need to think that land is multi-@@ func@@ tional .
and that fre@@ es you up to do other things .
we &apos;ve never had that before .
and as they slide their hand down the le@@ ver , they can push with a smaller effective le@@ ver l@@ ength , but push through a bigger angle every stro@@ ke , which makes a faster ro@@ ta@@ tional speed , and gives you an effective high ge@@ ar .
so we need g@@ ap@@ -@@ fil@@ l@@ ers like continu@@ um that can work on commer@@ ci@@ ali@@ zing , and we started a whole n@@ go to bring our chair to market -- global research innovation technology -- and then we also te@@ am@@ ed up with a big manufac@@ tur@@ er in india , p@@ inn@@ ac@@ le industri@@ es , that &apos;s to@@ ol@@ ed up now to make 500 cha@@ irs a month and will make the first bat@@ ch of 200 next month , which will be deli@@ vered in india .
when i was a kid , growing up in new york , i was s@@ mitten by sna@@ kes , the same way most kids are s@@ mitten by tops , mar@@ bles , cars , tra@@ ins , cri@@ cket ball@@ s .
and it really works to start with them .
you &apos;ve all heard , perhaps , of project tiger which started back in the early &apos; 7@@ 0s , which was , in fact , a very dynamic time for conser@@ vation .
in fact , if you see the map , the range of their original habit@@ at was all the way from the indu@@ s in pakistan to the ir@@ ra@@ wa@@ d@@ dy in bur@@ ma .
and it &apos;s a horri@@ bly pain@@ ful death .
and the thing is , you know , the decision makers , the folks in power , they &apos;re up in their b@@ ung@@ alo@@ ws and so on in del@@ hi , in the city capit@@ als . they are all supp@@ lied with pl@@ ent@@ y of water . it &apos;s cool .
and when the average person looks at a co@@ br@@ a going &quot; ss@@ ss@@ ss ! &quot; like that , they say , &quot; my god , look at that an@@ gry , dangerous cre@@ ature . &quot;
they &apos;re powerful tools for transformation , for quie@@ ting down our mind and bodies to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy , to be pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful , to be jo@@ y@@ ful and to realize that it &apos;s not something that you pur@@ sue and get , but rather it &apos;s something that you have already until you dist@@ ur@@ b it .
i got this as a christ@@ mas card a few years ago from two of the patients in one of our programs .
the most effective anti-@@ smo@@ king ad was this one .
miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i , more than 25 percent of people are over@@ weight .
and these are pre@@ domin@@ antly what are called the ome@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 f@@ at@@ ty ac@@ ids .
so , there are lots of reasons for eating this way that go beyond just your health .
he took women with meta@@ sta@@ tic breast cancer , rand@@ om@@ ly divi@@ ded them into two groups .
but you seem to have more hair .
now , this movie has flo@@ ated around hollywood for well over half a century , and we first got involved with the project in the early &apos; 9@@ 0s , with r@@ on howard as the director .
there were two studi@@ os involved : war@@ ner brothers and par@@ amount .
and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence .
we needed cre@@ ases and di@@ m@@ ples and wr@@ in@@ kl@@ es and all of those things .
and so , on the left , we were seeing 100,000 poly@@ g@@ ons .
but we needed to get a dat@@ ab@@ ase of him doing more than that .
and so we could choose numbers of posi@@ tions on the face to pull that data from .
skin dis@@ plac@@ ement : another big deal .
this is the q@@ al@@ and@@ ar community . they are a mar@@ g@@ in@@ alized islam@@ ic community who live across india , and have been in india since the 1@@ 3@@ th century .
we weren &apos;t sure at all . and we managed to convince him .
we &apos;ve been able to en@@ sure better fu@@ tures for the people and the be@@ ars .
now , that &apos;s not what i &apos;m here to talk about , but it is a fascinating aspe@@ ct of animal design .
so we kept on going , and this cam@@ el kept on trying to take a ch@@ un@@ k out of my leg .
so we &apos;ll need to be very care@@ ful around him . don &apos;t let him get you .
so , what the hell .
now , what you also didn &apos;t see was that -- and you may have noticed in the pen bes@@ i@@ de him and , by the way , the cam@@ el &apos;s name is su@@ ki .
long legs that allow heat to es@@ cape .
&quot; cam@@ els are like angel@@ s , &quot; a bed@@ ou@@ in once said .
but i rel@@ ented because it seemed like an interesting possibility , and also i &apos;m like a total carto@@ on jun@@ k@@ ie since childhood .
the next po@@ em is also rather short .
i lived in new york city .
b@@ c : i &apos;m not sure if other po@@ em@@ s will be anima@@ ted .
combin@@ ing dry wi@@ t with arti@@ stic dep@@ th , bil@@ ly coll@@ ins shares a project in which several of his po@@ em@@ s were turned into deli@@ ght@@ ful anima@@ ted films in a collaboration with s@@ und@@ ance chan@@ nel . five of them are inclu@@ ded in this wonder@@ fully enter@@ ta@@ ining and moving talk -- and don &apos;t miss the hil@@ ari@@ ous final po@@ em !
the principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is dama@@ ged by conflict , so you need to do something about it .
you can see that they work together , they pull at the same moment .
so it &apos;s actually fairly simple for them .
and then there &apos;s a cognitive chan@@ nel , which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else .
and for decades it had been as@@ sum@@ ed that only humans can do that , that only humans worry about the wel@@ f@@ are of somebody else .
so this is the 50 percent line that &apos;s the random expec@@ tation .
the first piece she e@@ ats .
and so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a mor@@ ality from the bottom up , so to speak , without necessarily god and religion involved , and to see how we can get to an evolved mor@@ ality .
so those that were sitting on the f@@ ence before , now have no reason not to .
so it had its down@@ sides .
i had to put on s@@ uns@@ cre@@ en .
and as dan bu@@ et@@ t@@ ner can tell you , having a strong social network is so cru@@ cial to our health .
so without noise redu@@ ction technology , our country would not exist .
a few years ago , my colleagues and i were interested in how a brain chemical called ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in would influence people &apos;s decisions in social situations .
here &apos;s one example : neur@@ o drin@@ ks , a line of products , including nu@@ er@@ o bli@@ ss here , which according to its lab@@ el helps reduce stress , en@@ han@@ ces mo@@ od , provi@@ des focused concent@@ ration , and pro@@ mot@@ es a positive out@@ look .
so how &apos;d they figure this out ?
what about the clin@@ ic ?
all knowledge of the english language and the english al@@ phab@@ et has been lost .
we don &apos;t know what any of these sym@@ b@@ ols mean .
first , there &apos;s no ro@@ sett@@ a stone .
and the indu@@ s scri@@ pt now has this particular property .
how many of you have ever sp@@ ill@@ ed coffee on a key@@ board ?
they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived , and so in this case , they were travel@@ ing by sea all the way to mes@@ o@@ po@@ tam@@ ia , pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day iraq .
so that was pretty exciting .
but the story of how we came to understand the universe is just as much a story of listening as it is by looking .
so thomas wat@@ son wasn &apos;t listening to us .
it &apos;s 196@@ 4 , and we &apos;re back at bell lab@@ s .
so he was han@@ ging out with the movie star , and of course they were gr@@ um@@ bling : &quot; he &apos;s supposed to be religious and all this .
and it &apos;s inside and outside , self and other , and other is all very different .
i , me , me , mine . it &apos;s like a perfect song , that song . a perfect teaching .
he feels the way they are harv@@ est@@ ing y@@ a@@ ks no@@ wa@@ days .
thank you .
but i think what &apos;s new is that we now have the capacity to communicate inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously across fron@@ ti@@ ers right across the world .
in the last 50@@ -@@ 60 years we have seen fas@@ c@@ ism , anti-@@ se@@ mi@@ tis@@ m , ra@@ c@@ ism , a@@ par@@ thei@@ d , dis@@ crimin@@ ation on the basis of sex and gender and sexu@@ ality ; all these have come under pressure because of the campaig@@ ns that have been run by people to change the world .
if people can find that that sub-@@ prime product has been trans@@ fer@@ red across nations many , many times until it ends up in ban@@ ks in ic@@ eland or the rest in britain , and people &apos;s ordinary sav@@ ings are affected by it , then you cannot rely on a system of national super@@ vision .
how did he die ?
it &apos;s not quite the ted prize , but it is an ex@@ clu@@ sive t-@@ shir@@ t from our lab .
it &apos;s still running at the human equivalent of 300 miles per hour .
in 195@@ 1 , es@@ cher made this drawing . he thought he created an animal fan@@ t@@ asy .
r@@ f : so if you look carefully at this , what you see is that they have sp@@ ines and until a few weeks ago , no one knew what they did .
now just because we have a distribu@@ ted foot and sp@@ ines doesn &apos;t mean you can clim@@ b ver@@ tical sur@@ faces .
these are all from different insects .
very strange . how do they stick ?
i call the new robot rise , for &quot; robot in sc@@ ans@@ ori@@ al environment &quot; -- that &apos;s a clim@@ bing environment -- and we have an extraordinary team of bi@@ ologists and engineers creating this robot .
to finish : we &apos;ve gotten design secre@@ ts from nature by looking at how feet are built .
and i mentioned i &apos;ll use some visual repres@@ ent@@ ations of sounds .
most of these distin@@ ctive sig@@ nature whi@@ st@@ les are quite ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ ed and stable through the life of a dolph@@ in .
i &apos;d also like to point out that sound doesn &apos;t o@@ be@@ y boundar@@ ies .
it was tra@@ cked for 4@@ 3 days , swi@@ mming 1,@@ 700 kilometers , or more than 1,000 miles .
now after i play back these hum@@ p@@ back calls , i &apos;ll play blue wh@@ ale calls , but they have to be sp@@ ed up because they &apos;re so low in frequ@@ ency that you wouldn &apos;t be able to hear it otherwise .
wh@@ ales also have contact calls like i described for the dolph@@ ins .
if you actually insu@@ late and isol@@ ate the machin@@ ery of the ship from the h@@ ul@@ l , you can reduce that noise by 99 percent .
this re@@ duced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent , which saved them money , and at the same time , it had a significant benefit for wh@@ ales .
we see these magni@@ fi@@ cent star nur@@ series , where nature has somehow arr@@ ange@@ d for just the right numbers and just the right si@@ zes of stars to be born for life to ar@@ ise .
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way , pull up other information -- there are lots of web and information sources about places you might want to go -- you can zo@@ om in , you can pull back out .
and every year there &apos;s research done on self-@@ repor@@ ted sh@@ y@@ ness among college students .
the average boy now wat@@ ches 50 por@@ n video cli@@ ps a week .
if i grab the can@@ v@@ as , i can kind of do the same thing -- stre@@ tch it out .
but the ne@@ at thing about it is i can add control points .
we have a big problem .
we need to open our eyes and see that we are not vic@@ ti@@ ms .
we need to move mexi@@ can society , the members of society who are at this level , to the next level , which is action .
and in this case , they did .
ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi , one of the greatest civil figh@@ ters of all time , said , &quot; be the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
so , one of the things that i love to do is to explore sk@@ ill .
and ju@@ g@@ gling -- the ball@@ s cross and all that .
and you could play with the rhyth@@ m .
ok ? so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it .
finger , finger , finger , p@@ ink or finger .
so , a moment .
the rhyth@@ m can get much smaller .
so , if you want to go with the music for cy@@ lin@@ ders .
michael mo@@ schen : ju@@ g@@ gling as art ... and science
but fir@@ ms like ours are having to move to a point where we get those objects that we &apos;re designing and get them in motion , showing how they &apos;ll be used .
i don &apos;t know if anybody &apos;s seen this -- it &apos;s pretty spec@@ tac@@ ular in the room .
in the second group &apos;s scen@@ ario , the walls are alive and actually give di@@ l@@ bert a group hu@@ g .
( the sp@@ y@@ fish is a revolution@@ ary sub@@ a@@ qua@@ tic video camera .
and in my own practice , from product to ap@@ prote@@ c , it &apos;s really exciting that we &apos;re taking a more human@@ -@@ cen@@ ter@@ ed approach to design , that we &apos;re including behaviors and person@@ ali@@ ties in the things we do , and i think this is great .
try as he might , he couldn &apos;t get away from her .
in the su@@ fi faith , this great middle eastern religion , which some cla@@ im is the rou@@ te of all religi@@ ons , su@@ fi ma@@ sters are all tele@@ pa@@ ths , so they say .
i don &apos;t know if you know this . modern physics , there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn &apos;t really exist , because it &apos;s too in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent for the fig@@ ures .
didn &apos;t catch on , unfortunately .
thomas e@@ dis@@ on once said , &quot; we don &apos;t know one percent of one milli@@ on@@ th about anything . &quot;
so we were thinking , well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books .
we took a page out of x@@ k@@ c@@ d , and we said , &quot; stand back .
as of about six months ago , the state of the art in this field is that you would , for instance , go up to the following psych@@ ologist with fab@@ ul@@ ous hair , and you &apos;d say , &quot; steve , you &apos;re an exper@@ t on the ir@@ regular ver@@ bs .
finally in 195@@ 4 , someone wo@@ ke up and realized that 19@@ 50 had gotten some@@ what pas@@ s@@ é .
and of course , what we &apos;re seeing is the fact mar@@ c ch@@ ag@@ all was a je@@ wish artist in na@@ z@@ i germany .
it &apos;s the app@@ lic@@ ation of massi@@ ve-@@ scale data colle@@ ction analysis to the study of human culture .
google has started to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze 15 million books .
but they actually create our reality in a way , because they tell us what we &apos;re paying attention to right now .
i don &apos;t know how much listening there is in this conversation , which is sa@@ dly very common , especially in the u.@@ k .
it &apos;s about enjo@@ ying m@@ und@@ an@@ e sounds .
i wrote a whole book about it . so i live to listen .
and i &apos;d be , like , &quot; this is my job . &quot;
and in the morning , her mom taught us how to try to make tor@@ ti@@ ll@@ as and wanted to give me a bi@@ ble , and she took me asi@@ de and she said to me in her broken english , &quot; your music has helped my daughter so much .
they were like , &quot; no , the sal@@ es are going down . it &apos;s a failure . &quot;
and i got a lot of cri@@ tic@@ ism online after my ki@@ ck@@ star@@ ter went big for continu@@ ing my crazy crow@@ d@@ sour@@ cing practic@@ es , specifically for asking musi@@ cians who are fan@@ s if they wanted to join us on stage for a few son@@ gs in exchange for love and ti@@ ckets and be@@ er , and this was a doc@@ tor@@ ed image that went up of me on a website .
don &apos;t make people pay for music , says am@@ anda pal@@ mer : let them . in a passionate talk that begins in her days as a street perfor@@ mer , she exam@@ ines the new relationship between artist and fan .
two weeks after my speech , in tun@@ isi@@ a , hundreds of portra@@ its were made .
while in iran at the same time ab@@ ol@@ ol@@ o -- of course a ni@@ ck@@ name -- has pa@@ sted one single face of a woman to show his resi@@ stance against the government .
and you know what ? it &apos;s just the beginning .
and one might have the impres@@ sion that we really knew a lot about brains .
and i said , i want to do this for four years , make some money , like i was having a family , and i would ma@@ ture a bit , and maybe the business of neuro@@ science would ma@@ ture a bit .
we have this mountain of data , which is an@@ atom@@ y , physi@@ ology and behavior .
some people say , brains can &apos;t understand brains .
in the case of the solar system , the idea that the earth is sp@@ inning and the surface of the earth is going like a thousand miles an hour , and the earth is going through the solar system about a million miles an hour .
you &apos;re all being intelligent right now , but you &apos;re not doing anything .
it &apos;s all those things , and all those gut re@@ actions you have .
and when you go home ton@@ ight , you &apos;re going to put your hand out there , and you &apos;re going to reach for the do@@ or@@ kno@@ b and you &apos;re going to notice it &apos;s in the wrong spot , and you &apos;ll go , who@@ a , something happened .
what &apos;s the fourth one ? that &apos;s how we test it . it &apos;s all about predi@@ ction .
it &apos;s an auto@@ matic play@@ back . and predi@@ ction of future in@@ puts is the des@@ i@@ red out@@ put .
they just knew like , hey , they were going to build calcul@@ ators and traffic light controll@@ ers . but it &apos;s going to be big .
it is using that money more ration@@ ally to make the countries of the world sec@@ ure , to make the people of the world sec@@ ure .
i don &apos;t follow that , but that &apos;s cool . &quot;
wan@@ gar@@ i ma@@ ath@@ ai -- 2004 peace lau@@ re@@ ate .
that &apos;s what i got stuck doing -- the land@@ mine campaign .
and grand@@ ma pus@@ hed the butt@@ on , and she said , &quot; oh , fantastic !
and sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the la@@ und@@ ry at home , or they have to bring the la@@ und@@ ry away to a stream far off .
and over there they don &apos;t even use one each .
they must change behavior in some way .
and we really , we really loved this machine .
do you see the subject ?
therefore , you google their names and in a certain universe , you find this information .
&#91; have you ever che@@ ated in an ex@@ am ? &#93; now to one group of subje@@ cts , we told them , &quot; only other students will see your answers . &quot;
you can find e@@ cho@@ es of this interpretation in john mil@@ ton &apos;s &quot; par@@ ad@@ ise lost . &quot;
and from that much contact with politicians , i can tell you they &apos;re all emotional fre@@ a@@ ks of one sort or another .
and if you &apos;re not talking about the individual relationship between a teacher and a student , you &apos;re not talking about that reality .
they buy these se@@ a@@ wee@@ d-@@ based s@@ n@@ ac@@ ks there called v@@ eg@@ gie bo@@ ot@@ y with k@@ ale , which is for kids who come home and say , &quot; mom , mom , i want a s@@ n@@ ack that &apos;ll help prevent col@@ on-@@ rec@@ tal cancer . &quot;
another finding is that the un@@ conscious , far from being du@@ m@@ b and sexu@@ alized , is actually quite smart .
when we watch por@@ no@@ graph@@ y , it &apos;s a little like having sex , though probably not as good .
they go through life like sa@@ il@@ bo@@ ats tac@@ king into the wind -- wan@@ ting to get close to people , but not really having the models of how to do that .
and the effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of a group is not determin@@ ed by the i@@ q of the group ; it &apos;s determin@@ ed by how well they communicate , how often they take turns in conversation .
through his suffering , ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter understood how deeply inter@@ pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated we are .
but that &apos;s not the only purpose that human beings are sold for .
they &apos;re killed ; we don &apos;t even hear about them .
and therefore my challenge was to understand how can i get out the power from this pain .
a very suppor@@ tive friend of mine , a well-@@ wi@@ sh@@ er of mine , used to give me every month , 2,000 ru@@ pe@@ es for vege@@ tables .
i &apos;m not asking you all to become ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ his or martin lu@@ ther k@@ ings , or me@@ d@@ ha pat@@ k@@ ars , or something like that .
but &quot; le@@ xi@@ co@@ graphi@@ cal &quot; is the same pattern as &quot; hig@@ g@@ le@@ d@@ y-@@ pig@@ g@@ le@@ dy . &quot;
so he &apos;s really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dic@@ tion@@ aries today .
right ? those little butt@@ ons , i had them all exp@@ and@@ ed except for the date ch@@ art .
how can this be ? i mean , i love books . i really love books .
being in the dic@@ tion@@ ary is an artificial distin@@ ction .
that &apos;s a le@@ xi@@ co@@ graphi@@ cal co@@ p out , to say , &quot; mis@@ cell@@ an@@ e@@ ous technical senses . &quot;
i don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting his picture taken there any@@ time soon .
so i &apos;m really sorry . but when you use a part of something -- like the dic@@ tion@@ ary is a part of the language , or a fla@@ g stands for the united states , it &apos;s a symbol of the country -- then you &apos;re using it sy@@ ne@@ c@@ do@@ ch@@ ically .
a magazine i &apos;d recently launched called business 2.@@ 0 was f@@ at@@ ter than a tele@@ phone direc@@ tory , bus@@ y pump@@ ing hot air into the bubble .
and at about the same time , and i think par@@ tly because of that , i started doing something that i &apos;d for@@ gotten about in my business focus : i started to read again .
it &apos;s the mental equivalent of the full body mas@@ sage .
what sa@@ pl@@ ing &apos;s ow@@ ner@@ ship means is that all of the proce@@ e@@ ds of ted will go towards the causes that sa@@ pl@@ ing stands for .
imagine , for example , an aug@@ mented reality ap@@ p that over@@ la@@ ys a virtual world to milli@@ me@@ ter-@@ level pre@@ c@@ ision on top of the physical world .
&quot; i already have , &quot; she repli@@ ed .
so , turning on a wave bubble might not just cause in@@ conven@@ i@@ ence .
let me show you some actual foot@@ age from that very first experiment .
it &apos;ll be fascinating to see how this all turns out .
and if it &apos;s even more sil@@ ent , they stre@@ tch their ne@@ cks out .
it &apos;s a very early video , so we haven &apos;t yet de@@ alt with the over@@ la@@ p and all of that , but that got re@@ fin@@ ed pretty soon , later .
so this is the last work , and a work in progress , and it &apos;s called &quot; space fil@@ ler . &quot;
this is the design situation : a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban .
and so it takes a very large foot@@ print on the land , a very large foot@@ print in terms of materials , five to 10 times what you &apos;d use for nuclear , and typically to get one gi@@ ga@@ watt of electricity is on the order of 250 square miles of wind farm .
bab@@ co@@ ck &amp; amp ; wil@@ co@@ x that make nuclear re@@ ac@@ tors , here &apos;s an inte@@ gra@@ l fast re@@ actor .
while you &apos;re waiting around for your nuclear , you have to run the regular electric power gri@@ d , which is mostly coal in the united states and around the world .
that would take between one and three square kilometers of foot@@ print on the ground , entirely .
and it consi@@ ders just using exi@@ sting hy@@ dr@@ o to match the h@@ our@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ hour power demand .
so the other thing is , we don &apos;t need nuclear energy .
secon@@ dly , think about this .
i will also add one other thing .
fif@@ te@@ en percent of the entire u.@@ s .
the analog@@ y for me is al@@ as@@ ka . you know , we bought al@@ as@@ ka .
they had to make up everything .
if you calcu@@ late the amount of potential energy , m@@ gh , to take you and your spac@@ es@@ u@@ it up to a couple hundred miles , and then you acceler@@ ate yourself to 17@@ ,@@ 500 miles per hour -- remember , that one half m@@ v squ@@ ared -- and you figure it out .
pilot : rele@@ ase our fire .
we spent 11 years getting fa@@ a appro@@ val to do zero gravity fli@@ ghts .
if you were going to go and try to create spac@@ es@@ hi@@ po@@ ne , or any kind of a new technology , you have to fund that from the beginning and main@@ tain that fund@@ ing with an un@@ certain out@@ come .
would they de@@ light us ?
we can make fol@@ ds that we otherwise could not make .
i started using four cy@@ lin@@ ders .
from this shape , we calcul@@ ated a cutting line , and then we gave this cutting line to a las@@ er cu@@ tter to produce -- and you &apos;re seeing a se@@ gment of it here -- very many thin sli@@ ces , individu@@ ally cut , on top of each other .
how many people here are over the age of 4@@ 8 ?
what &apos;s a drug ? a drug is made up of a small molecule of hydro@@ gen , carbon , oxygen , ni@@ tro@@ gen , and a few other atoms all co@@ b@@ bled together in a shape , and it &apos;s those shapes that deter@@ mine whether , in fact , that particular drug is going to hit its target .
well , one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology , and a very important technology that we dep@@ end on for all of this is the human genome , the ability to be able to look at a chromo@@ some , to un@@ zi@@ p it , to pull out all the dna , and to be able to then read out the letters in that dna code , the a &apos;s , c &apos;s , g &apos;s and t &apos;s that are our instru@@ ction book and the instru@@ ction book for all living things , and the cost of doing this , which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars , has in the course of the last 10 years fallen faster than mo@@ ore &apos;s law , down to the point where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequen@@ ced , or mine , and we &apos;re head@@ ed for the $ 1,000 genome fairly soon .
what would you say to them both about research on pro@@ geria and maybe about other conditions as well ?
let me tell you another thing we could do .
we need the best and the bri@@ gh@@ test from many different discipl@@ ines to come and join this effort -- all ages , all different groups -- because this is the time , folks .
and yes , q@@ at@@ ar wants to be a modern nation .
i want to ask you , why do you think this is ?
we don &apos;t want to have what there is in the west .
k@@ hal@@ ed : why would i want to put it on ?
famili@@ ar@@ ity destro@@ ys and tr@@ um@@ ps fear . try it .
and all of a sudden ...
and then i sat down and all the ants came along .
some of them were quite ja@@ g@@ ged .
the instrument that i used turned into a cat@@ ap@@ ult .
so i didn &apos;t think he was going to throw b@@ art off .
but i would never do it to a living fly .
so say if you cut a period stop in half , a full stop , that &apos;s about the size of the whole thing .
the most famous stat@@ ue in the world .
that ship there , that &apos;s made from 24@@ -@@ kar@@ at gold .
and because god himself said that the primary at@@ tribu@@ te of his is compassion -- in fact , the kor@@ an says that &quot; god de@@ cre@@ ed upon himself compassion , &quot; or , &quot; rei@@ g@@ ned himself in by compassion &quot; -- therefore , our obje@@ ctive and our mission must be to be sources of compassion , activ@@ ators of compassion , ac@@ tors of compassion and speak@@ ers of compassion and do@@ ers of compassion .
and when i love my ser@@ v@@ ant , &quot; god says , &quot; i become the eyes by which he or she sees , the e@@ ars by which he or she li@@ stens , the hand by which he or she gras@@ ps , and the foot by which he or she wal@@ ks , and the heart by which he or she under@@ stands . &quot;
ru@@ m@@ i has another story about three men , a tur@@ k , an ar@@ ab and -- and i forget the third person , but for my sa@@ ke , it could be a mal@@ ay .
we lived on robert e . lee b@@ ou@@ le@@ v@@ ard .
and to think that the tumor was in the same bone , in the same place in my body as the accident 3@@ 8 years earlier -- it seemed like too much of a co@@ inci@@ dence .
she &apos;s got a big s@@ mile . she &apos;s got a big person@@ ality .
i sort of fri@@ en@@ d-@@ married each of these guys .
what would you tell them ? &quot;
and i remember a particular one night that , when you told that story of -- i don &apos;t know where you are dr . nu@@ land -- of willi@@ am slo@@ an@@ e co@@ ff@@ in -- it made me think of it .
and when i have no more love left , i just drink milk , because that &apos;s where love comes from . &quot;
&quot; but when i came to see you , &quot; i said , &quot; i didn &apos;t believe in myself .
and it &apos;s become my own mot@@ to for my girls .
as i was going there , i was wondering , what would i say depen@@ ding on what happened here .
but derek , your tiny hand must have gone out to that thing and actually bas@@ hed it , bas@@ hed it so hard they thought it was going to break .
this is a photo of you , derek , playing at the bar@@ bi@@ can with the ro@@ y@@ al phil@@ harmon@@ ic po@@ ps .
a@@ o : derek , let &apos;s have a bo@@ w .
derek &apos;s going to l@@ .@@ a@@ . soon , and it &apos;s a mi@@ le@@ stone , because it means that derek and i will have spent over 100 hours on long-@@ hau@@ l fli@@ ghts together , which is quite interesting , isn &apos;t it derek ?
derek para@@ vi@@ cin@@ i and adam o@@ ck@@ el@@ ford : in the key of geni@@ us
one other thing about it , if you do have one at home , let me tell you one of the fe@@ atures you may not know : when you fall as@@ le@@ ep , it comes alive and it wal@@ ks around your house and goes through your mail and wat@@ ches you as you sleep .
john ho@@ d@@ g@@ man : design , expla@@ ined .
i &apos;ve been studying chimpanze@@ es in tanz@@ ania since 1960 .
anyway , david gre@@ y@@ be@@ ard -- and i saw that he was pi@@ cking little pieces of gr@@ ass and using them to fish ter@@ mit@@ es from their under@@ ground nest .
and i don &apos;t have time to go into the information that will prove some of these things to you , save to say that there are very bright students , in the best universi@@ ties , studying emotions in animals , studying person@@ ali@@ ties in animals .
didn &apos;t they know what was happening ?
everything is hop@@ eless -- we &apos;re always being told so by the media . &quot;
we &apos;re in every state now , and the problems in florida are different from the problems in new york .
one -- one to two .
she said , &quot; if you &apos;re talking about hope and peace , ring this .
life also has a me@@ tab@@ oli@@ s@@ m . now this is a process by which life can conver@@ t resources from the environment into building blocks so it can main@@ tain and build itself .
what about the other aspe@@ cts of living systems ?
we take this same moving proto@@ cell here , and we put it in another experiment , get it moving . then i &apos;m going to add some food to the system , and you &apos;ll see that in blue here , right ?
but then something even more interesting happens .
but they have life@@ like properties , is the point .
it &apos;s a clin@@ ic like a health clin@@ ic at any other university , except people come to the clin@@ ic with environmental health concern@@ s , and they walk out with pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions for things they can do to improve environmental health , as op@@ posed to coming to a clin@@ ic with medical concern@@ s and walking out with pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions for pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tic@@ als .
and then you have to introduce your ta@@ d@@ pole and who it &apos;s named after .
this guy also liked pla@@ in water and the muscle rela@@ x@@ ant .
that 99 percent of the time when a fire@@ tru@@ ck is not par@@ king there , it &apos;s in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating pollu@@ tan@@ ts .
what we do is actually put a standard h@@ va@@ c filter on the top of that .
there &apos;s a good person .
when the bu@@ o@@ ys get your text , they win@@ k at you twice to say , we &apos;ve got your message .
but since then , much progress has been made , both in our lab and other lab@@ s around the world .
until bio@@ fabri@@ c@@ ation is better understood , it is clear that , ini@@ tially at least , more people would be willing to wear no@@ vel materials than would be willing to eat no@@ vel fo@@ ods , no matter how deli@@ cious .
you don &apos;t have that kind of fine control with conven@@ tional lea@@ ther .
people love their automo@@ bil@@ es .
so we embar@@ ked upon the rein@@ ven@@ tion around an electro@@ chemical engine , the fuel cell , hydro@@ gen as the energy car@@ rier .
but the real exciting vision that we see truly is home re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing , much like re@@ char@@ ging your laptop or re@@ char@@ ging your cell@@ phone .
you know , i could be wrong about this , but my sense is that in the public mind , today , that g@@ m is not vie@@ wed as serious about some of these environmental ideas as some of your japanese competi@@ tors , maybe even as ford .
not so much .
and so every year , i share my background with my kids , because they need to know that everyone has a story , everyone has a struggle , and everyone needs help along the way .
so even though teachers were against it because we emplo@@ y one-@@ year contra@@ cts -- you can &apos;t teach , or you don &apos;t want to teach , you don &apos;t get to be at my school with my kids .
a mar@@ vel@@ ous place .
i started to have infe@@ ction everywhere .
we started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees , only local species , only na@@ tive species , where we built an ecosystem iden@@ tical to the one that was destro@@ yed , and the life started to come back in an incredible way .
india has no more trees . spa@@ in has no more trees .
now i &apos;ll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago .
this experience and this training lead me to get a wonderful job with the wild@@ life conser@@ vation society , which works to save wild@@ life and wild places all over the world .
here &apos;s bow@@ ling green . and here &apos;s broad@@ way .
we can calcu@@ late the winter wind ex@@ pos@@ ure -- so , which way the winter win@@ ds b@@ low across the landscape .
so we just started making a list .
we call these mu@@ ir we@@ bs after the scot@@ ti@@ sh@@ -@@ american natur@@ alist john mu@@ ir , who said , &quot; when we try to pick out anything by itself , we find that it &apos;s bo@@ und fast by a thousand invisible cor@@ ds that cannot be broken , to everything in the universe . &quot;
and we can see this in the geogra@@ ph@@ y of the city today .
so just bear with me . we &apos;ll go real fast , you know ?
it &apos;s going to be a pretty crow@@ ded place , at least eight billion people .
and given that i have 13 minutes to do this , this is going to go kind of quick .
you can start to know where things are .
they live in the emerging me@@ g@@ ac@@ i@@ ties of the developing world .
this is a tel@@ ec@@ ent@@ r@@ o in sa@@ o pau@@ l@@ o .
we talk about how another world isn &apos;t just possible ; another world &apos;s here .
you get new tools for people in the developing world .
audience : it dete@@ cts land@@ min@@ es .
and poli@@ cing copy@@ right viol@@ ations for children &apos;s birth@@ day c@@ ak@@ es was such a has@@ s@@ le that the college bak@@ ery said , &quot; you know what , we &apos;re getting out of that business .
but technology moved on , as technology is won@@ t to do .
plan b appe@@ ared in its first ful@@ l-@@ blo@@ wn form in 199@@ 8 -- something called the digital mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um copy@@ right act .
because in the end , the real threat to the en@@ ac@@ t@@ ment of pi@@ pa and sop@@ a is our ability to share things with one another .
and all of this goes back to the failure of the d@@ m@@ ca to dis@@ allow sharing as a technical means .
the whole world was la@@ id out for me .
el@@ ders came to me and said , &quot; are you running from the police ? &quot;
a traditional bone se@@ tter is a professional .
it was built by 12 bar@@ e@@ foot architec@@ ts who can &apos;t read and write , built on $ 1.@@ 50 a s@@ q@@ . ft .
and everything works off the sun for the next 25 years .
but all the schools are sol@@ ar-@@ li@@ t .
these pu@@ p@@ pe@@ ts are made out of recycl@@ ed world bank repor@@ ts .
and in six months they can become solar engineers .
but they will . the grand@@ mothers will . &quot;
i &apos;ll just wind up by saying that i think you don &apos;t have to look for solutions outside .
and our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynam@@ ically var@@ ying computers in the world for this kind of data explor@@ ation .
you see the electr@@ on flow with the stre@@ am@@ lines we as artists have gener@@ ated for the scientists .
inspi@@ re us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we &apos;ve created at s@@ ant@@ a bar@@ bar@@ a .
you probably don &apos;t feel like you need a moment of thought .
now , you don &apos;t need me to give you too many examples of people syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing happiness , i sus@@ pe@@ ct . though i &apos;m going to show you some experiment@@ al evidence , you don &apos;t have to look very far for evidence .
and he thought , &quot; that &apos;s a really ne@@ at idea ! &quot;
now , i &apos;m a scientist , so i &apos;m going to do this not with r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic , but by mar@@ in@@ ating you in a little bit of data .
we took our mon@@ et prin@@ ts to the hospital .
what these people did when they syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zed happiness is they really , truly changed their affec@@ tive , he@@ don@@ ic , a@@ es@@ thetic re@@ actions to that poster .
yeah , he has a heart of gold ; don &apos;t touch the fru@@ it@@ ca@@ ke . right ?
wr@@ on@@ g-@@ o . bad simul@@ ators . because here &apos;s what &apos;s really happening .
but when those pre@@ fer@@ ences drive us too hard and too fast because we have over@@ r@@ ated the difference between these fu@@ tures , we are at risk .
ma@@ ver@@ i@@ cks : we had to call it ro@@ cket ma@@ ver@@ i@@ cks .
it is this brea@@ th@@ taking image -- success , of course -- that motiv@@ ates us and motiv@@ ates kids to follow and understand ro@@ cket science : to understand the importance of physics and math and , in many ways , to sort of have that a@@ we at explor@@ ation of the fron@@ ti@@ ers of the un@@ known .
ca@@ ma@@ gu@@ ey is a pro@@ vin@@ ce in cu@@ ba .
i &apos;m not telling you that story .
&quot; you don &apos;t speak english ? &quot;
i said , &quot; is that thing real ? &quot;
i said , &quot; ma , pick a lan@@ e ! &quot;
&quot; yeah ? what ?
i sent him to the store , which was my first mistake , and he went to buy under@@ wear , and he bought the gri@@ p@@ pers , and he &apos;s supposed to buy the bo@@ x@@ ers . &quot;
and she &apos;s still talking while she puts the car in park , hits the emergen@@ cy bra@@ ke , op@@ ens the door , and with a spr@@ y@@ ness a@@ sto@@ unding in a woman her age , she jum@@ ps out of the car , kno@@ cks out the phone books , and then she wal@@ ks around -- she &apos;s carrying her cheap k@@ m@@ art pur@@ se with her -- around the front of the car .
don &apos;t you want to look ?
&quot; i &apos;m not going anywhere . &quot;
i said , &quot; no , i follow little old women around par@@ king lots to see if they &apos;ll stop . yes , it &apos;s my mother ! &quot;
if we started today , 10 years from now , at the end of this window of opportunity , those fu@@ el-@@ efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent .
it &apos;s because they said , &quot; it &apos;s eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day .
so , the last example of this is con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on pri@@ cing , very fam@@ ously done in london .
there is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divi@@ de , respond to emergen@@ cies , get traffic moving , provide a new engine for economic growth and dra@@ matically reduce co2 emissions in every sector .
there isn &apos;t anybody in washington lo@@ bb@@ ying to make it happen -- or in those m@@ uni@@ ci@@ p@@ ali@@ ties , to build out their cities with these wir@@ eless networks -- because there &apos;s zero on@@ going communic@@ ations cost .
imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero .
we grew up taking for gran@@ ted a lot of the things that my parents couldn &apos;t take for gran@@ ted when they grew up -- things like power always on in our houses , things like schools across the street and hospit@@ als down the road and po@@ p@@ si@@ cles in the back@@ y@@ ard .
on a sun@@ day night .
so let &apos;s talk about those three as .
because you all used to be three years old .
and so what i love about this story is that ro@@ sey gri@@ er is just such an authenti@@ c person , and that &apos;s what auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity is all about .
i was eating o@@ lives with p@@ ie .
we &apos;ve got books , bu@@ ff@@ ets and radio waves , we@@ d@@ ding bri@@ des and roll@@ er@@ co@@ aster ri@@ des .
j even on the col@@ dest winter days .
in fact we &apos;re fin@@ ishing a book which is called &quot; pleasure , &quot; which is about sen@@ su@@ al pleasure in spaces .
and i sat in on several meetings .
so seeing this in a very simple , dig@@ ni@@ fied way was a very powerful experience .
so this develop@@ er said , &quot; you know what , we &apos;ll under@@ write the entire expen@@ se . &quot;
richard , i think very cor@@ rec@@ tly , made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers im@@ pos@@ ing a@@ es@@ thetic solutions on this kind of universal , ban@@ al , common problem of sitting .
it en@@ ables that conversation to get serious .
dr : we &apos;re looking from ful@@ ton street , west .
aw@@ w@@ w@@ w .
close .
isn &apos;t it weird that my 4@@ 8@@ -year-old husband is forever losing his way home in the car , from the dri@@ ve@@ way ? &quot;
it died in large part because it l@@ ac@@ ked const@@ it@@ u@@ ent bu@@ y-@@ in ; it l@@ ac@@ ked sta@@ ke@@ hol@@ der tra@@ ction .
so i discovered some very interesting things .
so here &apos;s a new definition for do@@ od@@ ling .
my friends , the do@@ od@@ le has never been the ne@@ mes@@ is of intellectual thought .
the pat@@ ents on those drugs were held by a number of western pharma@@ ce@@ u@@ tical companies that were not necessarily willing to make those pat@@ ents available .
there &apos;s something else that can really sc@@ are gener@@ ic manufac@@ tur@@ ers away .
and this is no longer fan@@ t@@ asy .
mexico temperature has been , air temperature has been something between 15 , up to 30 degrees c , and people enjo@@ yed themselves .
if we apply the best architec@@ tural design , climate engineering design , we won &apos;t get much better .
and the same idea to use there , to create out@@ door conditions which are percei@@ ved as comfortable . people enjoy going there instead of going into a sh@@ opp@@ ing m@@ all , which is chil@@ led down and which is cool@@ ed . we wanted to create an out@@ door space which is so comfortable that people can go there in the early after@@ noon , even in these sun@@ ny and hot summer months , and they can enjoy and meet there with their families .
but what fu@@ els this ?
often the roo@@ fs are broken , so you don &apos;t have enough dar@@ k@@ ness in the classroom to do these things .
v@@ v : so ...
and the daughter &apos;s husband , he also was sick from his wife &apos;s ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ on .
but the visual complexity is still very high .
another more sub@@ tle possibility is that they start ga@@ ining weight , and it changes your ideas of what an accep@@ table body size is .
and we started explor@@ ing all kinds of other phenomen@@ a .
and this is one of the first images we made to study this phenomenon .
so the friend of a friend of a &apos;s is , back again , a friend of a &apos;s , whereas the friend of a friend of b &apos;s is not a friend of b &apos;s , but is far@@ ther away in the network .
how does this help us figure out some of the problems that are affec@@ ting us these days ?
and what i think the world needs now is more connections .
but the more we learn about aging , the clear@@ er it becomes that a s@@ wee@@ ping down@@ ward course is gross@@ ly in@@ accu@@ rate .
and using this inten@@ se study of individuals , we find that it &apos;s not one particular generation that &apos;s doing better than the others , but the same individuals over time come to report relatively greater positive experience .
well in our research , we &apos;ve found that these changes are gro@@ unded fundament@@ ally in the uni@@ qu@@ ely human ability to monit@@ or time -- not just clock time and cal@@ end@@ ar time , but lifetime .
in the 20th century we added an un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented number of years to our li@@ fes@@ p@@ ans , but is the quality of life as good ? surpris@@ ingly , yes ! at tedx@@ women psych@@ ologist lau@@ ra car@@ sten@@ sen shows research that demon@@ str@@ ates that as people get older they become happ@@ ier , more content , and have a more positive out@@ look on the world . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and from these bedro@@ oms and living rooms and gar@@ ages , with cheap web@@ cam@@ s , lies the world &apos;s great dan@@ cers of tomorrow .
that &apos;s not a k@@ ru@@ mp move . you &apos;re going to throw it out , you throw it out , and you hold it .
on this piece of paper is the history the way i learned it from my la@@ k@@ ota friends and family .
18@@ 7@@ 1 : the indian appropri@@ ation act makes all indi@@ ans wards of the feder@@ al government .
the move destro@@ yed the reser@@ va@@ tions , making it easier to further sub@@ divi@@ de and to sell with every pas@@ sing generation .
19@@ 80 : the lon@@ gest running cour@@ t case in u.s. history , the si@@ ou@@ x nation v@@ . the united states , was rul@@ ed upon by the u.s. su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t .
this is how we came to own these united states .
a@@ ar@@ on hu@@ ey : america &apos;s na@@ tive pris@@ on@@ ers of war
well the easy answer is , we just haven &apos;t gotten those sal@@ ts to those people .
here i have a bunch of other examples , all suff@@ er from the last mile problem .
just so you don &apos;t embar@@ r@@ ass y@@ ourselves , i &apos;ll give you the right answer : it &apos;s increase .
and if you want to understand how it &apos;s more complex let me start with something kind of interesting .
i want you to do it fast , and say it out l@@ oud with me , and do it quickly . i &apos;ll make the first one easy for you .
so , what i want you to think about for a few minutes is : how would you con@@ vey safety of the b@@ m@@ w ? okay ?
b@@ w@@ m reali@@ zes safety , in people &apos;s minds , has two components .
it &apos;s much easier to use , much less pain@@ ful .
the amount of resources we put in are dis@@ par@@ ate .
let &apos;s come up with a few ideas , test them , see which is working , go back , syn@@ thes@@ ize , and try to come up with a thing that works , &quot; and then we &apos;re able to scale with part@@ ners .
so what does that mean ?
we &apos;ve actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab .
&quot; wor@@ rying sol@@ ves nothing . &quot;
thank you so much .
i start here , pal@@ m down , you can follow .
which number ? one , two , three , four or five ?
impres@@ sive . thank you .
any style -- yeah , good .
but not too much .
23 -- 24 , sorry , 24 .
l@@ g : par@@ don ?
which card shall i use ? queen or five ?
l@@ g : but you see the hand .
wait , wait , wait -- please take any card .
another suit . l@@ g : diam@@ on@@ ds , perfect .
empathy .
ace of diam@@ on@@ ds , yes ? zo@@ e : yeah .
so here , all the cards are face down -- you agree ?
and then , king , after exactly five seconds .
i see some of you recognize this child .
i went back and i trans@@ formed my entire company into a one-@@ bu@@ t@@ to@@ ck company . &quot;
if you were ton@@ e-@@ dea@@ f , you couldn &apos;t change the ge@@ ars on your car , in a stick shift car .
so let &apos;s see what &apos;s really going on here .
i always tell my students , &quot; if you have a de@@ cep@@ tive ca@@ dence , be sure to raise your e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws . then everybody will know . &quot;
a belo@@ ved grandmother , a lo@@ ver -- somebody in your life who you love with all your heart , but that person is no longer with you .
if you thought , everybody lo@@ ves classi@@ cal music -- they just haven &apos;t found out about it yet . &quot;
so now , i have one last thought , which is that it really makes a difference what we say -- the words that come out of our mouth .
i don &apos;t want to tell you a story .
to one group he said , &quot; i &apos;m going to time you to establi@@ sh nor@@ ms , a@@ ver@@ ages for how long it typically takes someone to solve this sort of problem . &quot;
if you look at the science , there is a mis@@ match between what science knows and what business does .
low-@@ cost provi@@ ders around the world can do it che@@ aper .
okay ? but one the task called for even ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary cognitive sk@@ ill , a larger reward led to poor@@ er performance .
around the desire to do things because they matter , because we like it , because they &apos;re interesting , because they are part of something important .
so that engineers use this time to come up with a cool pat@@ ch for code , come up with an elegan@@ t ha@@ ck .
the mi@@ d-@@ 199@@ 0s , microsoft started an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia called en@@ car@@ ta .
so , if we re@@ pair this mis@@ match between what science knows and what business does , if we bring our motivation , no@@ tions of motivation into the 21@@ st century , if we get past this la@@ zy , dangerous , ide@@ ology of car@@ ro@@ ts and sti@@ cks , we can streng@@ then our businesses , we can solve a lot of those c@@ and@@ le problems , and maybe , maybe , maybe we can change the world .
and that &apos;s what suppor@@ ts the object and kee@@ ps it stable .
so you can see it ro@@ tat@@ ing here .
this has a diam@@ on@@ d-@@ bot@@ tom@@ ed la@@ ke .
it has on-@@ board gener@@ ators .
they &apos;re little . they &apos;re five years old .
it &apos;s an a@@ par@@ thei@@ d , and it dis@@ crimin@@ ates against the &#91; non@@ profit &#93; sector in five different areas , the first being comp@@ en@@ sation .
they raised more money more quickly for these causes than any events in history , all based on the idea that people are we@@ ary of being asked to do the least they can possibly do .
if we have any dou@@ b@@ ts about the effects of this separate rule book , this stati@@ stic is so@@ ber@@ ing : from 19@@ 70 to 2009 , the number of non@@ prof@@ its that really grew , that cros@@ sed the $ 50 million an@@ nu@@ al re@@ venue bar@@ rier , is 14@@ 4 .
now , this idea that over@@ head is somehow an ene@@ my of the cause creates this second , much larger problem , which is , it forces organizations to go without the over@@ head things they really need to grow in the interest of keeping over@@ head low .
here &apos;s how all of this im@@ pac@@ ts the big picture .
and i go on the po@@ dium .
you know , ar@@ th@@ ur ru@@ bin@@ stein , the pian@@ ist , used to say that , &quot; anywhere in the world , people that have the flu , they go to the doctor .
and not all conduc@@ tors do just that .
it &apos;s mo@@ z@@ art as i , ri@@ c@@ car@@ do mu@@ ti , understand it . &quot;
let &apos;s see another super@@ -@@ conduc@@ tor , a ger@@ man super@@ -@@ conduc@@ tor . her@@ bert von kar@@ a@@ j@@ an , please .
and he cu@@ es in a fl@@ ute player like this .
and that &apos;s what makes them into part@@ ners .
you might be surprised having seen klei@@ ber as such a hyper@@ active guy .
len@@ ny ber@@ n@@ stein , my own personal ma@@ e@@ str@@ o .
other stories are that everything is on the ver@@ ge of un@@ ra@@ vel@@ ing .
and that &apos;s why , now , the new break@@ through@@ s , the new fron@@ ti@@ ers in terms of oil extra@@ ction are sc@@ ra@@ m@@ bling about in al@@ ber@@ ta , or at the bottom of the oceans .
and we have the el@@ ves in the form of china .
it &apos;s self-@@ organi@@ zing . there is no great central organization that pus@@ hes this ; people just pick up an idea and they run with it , and they imple@@ ment it where they are .
they pick up some of the tools that we &apos;ve developed .
another thing that they do is what we call an energy des@@ cent plan , which is basically to develop a plan b for the town .
but let us honor what it has bought us , and move forward from this point .
now this leaves 10 percent de@@ fic@@ it , sort of a min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing number .
it &apos;s got holes .
if you don &apos;t change that re@@ venue picture , if you don &apos;t solve what you &apos;re doing in health care , you &apos;re going to be d@@ ein@@ v@@ est@@ ing in the young .
no , they wa@@ sted their money on this . what about this thing ? -- it really is quite phenomen@@ al .
now i think this is a sol@@ vable problem .
i wanted to become that kind of red cross doctor , that doctor without bor@@ ders .
music tran@@ sc@@ ends the a@@ es@@ thetic beauty alone .
in each shot glass is a different sc@@ ented oil .
many people told me a big part of the no@@ od@@ le-@@ eating experience is the sl@@ ur@@ ping noise .
chris &apos; clock shows us that even raising just one of those other senses can make for a brilliant product .
good design looks great , yes -- but why shouldn &apos;t it also feel great , smell great and sound great ? designer j@@ in@@ so@@ p lee shares his theory of 5@@ -@@ sense design , with a handy graph and a few examples . his hope : to inspi@@ re you to notice great multi@@ sensor@@ y experiences .
they &apos;re sho@@ cked .
yes , it &apos;s the first sentence of fran@@ z k@@ af@@ ka &apos;s &quot; the me@@ tam@@ or@@ pho@@ sis . &quot;
or the moment you developed the first film you shot with an old camera .
here &apos;s my story : i was an ei@@ gh@@ th gra@@ der and i enter@@ ed a drawing con@@ test at school in g@@ ye@@ on@@ g@@ bo@@ k@@ gung .
he stuck hand@@ leb@@ ars into a bi@@ ke seat and called it &quot; bu@@ ll &apos;s head . &quot; sounds convin@@ cing , right ?
but they can often reve@@ al themselves nega@@ tively , in the form of je@@ al@@ ous@@ y .
i have students like you in the class -- many who don &apos;t major in writing .
they came to earth brie@@ fly trans@@ formed to stop you from being arti@@ stic , from becoming artists .
any ad@@ vice for as@@ pir@@ ing kore@@ an dan@@ cers ? &quot;
our instrument took this image of the v@@ eil of ven@@ us , which turned out to be a smo@@ g of su@@ l@@ fu@@ ri@@ c ac@@ id .
so i decided to give a public talk cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zing the lack of an appropriate energy policy .
it &apos;s about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity .
as earth war@@ ms , now because of extra co2 we put in the atmosphere , ice will melt , and co2 and me@@ than@@ e will be rele@@ ased by warming ocean and mel@@ ting per@@ ma@@ fro@@ st .
an important impact , if global warming continu@@ es , will be on the bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ ket of our nation and the world , the mid@@ west and great pla@@ ins , which are expected to become pr@@ one to extreme dr@@ ou@@ ghts , worse than the d@@ ust bow@@ l , within just a few decades , if we let global warming continue .
if we start next year , it is six percent per year .
they had no safety , no real technology .
and that &apos;s in the up position . when you step on it , either by remote control or with the pressure of your foot , it will fire you , depen@@ ding on the gas pressure , anything from five feet to 30 feet .
it &apos;s a great job , really .
and that &apos;s interesting because they are almost retro@@ spe@@ ctive .
and just how bra@@ ve he was in 1960 , bear in mind .
you need a pressure suit .
this is mor@@ oc@@ co last year in the at@@ las mountains , training in prepar@@ ation for some high al@@ titude jum@@ ps .
i would like to bring co@@ st@@ a on , if he &apos;s here , to show you the only one of its kind in the world .
i have an interest in education -- actually , what i find is everybody has an interest in education .
and the teacher said , &quot; but nobody knows what god looks like . &quot;
we stig@@ mati@@ ze mista@@ kes . and we &apos;re now running national education systems where mista@@ kes are the worst thing you can make .
you &apos;d think it would be otherwise , but it isn &apos;t .
and there you will see it -- grown men and women wri@@ thing un@@ controll@@ ably , off the beat , waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it .
one , it &apos;s diver@@ se . we think about the world in all the ways that we experience it . we think visu@@ ally , we think in sound , we think kin@@ es@@ the@@ tically .
anyway , she went to see this speci@@ alist . so , this o@@ ak@@ -@@ pan@@ el@@ ed room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sat on this chair at the end , and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems gil@@ li@@ an was having at school . and at the end of it -- because she was dist@@ ur@@ bing people ; her home@@ work was always late ; and so on , little kid of eight -- in the end , the doctor went and sat next to gil@@ li@@ an and said , &quot; gil@@ li@@ an , i &apos;ve listen@@ ed to all these things that your mother &apos;s told me , and i need to speak to her priv@@ ately . &quot;
the middle east is huge , and with all our problems , one thing &apos;s for sure : we love to lau@@ gh .
i had four ph@@ ases to this plan .
now , were the axis successful ?
enough .
today , we &apos;ve seen a 6@@ 3@@ -@@ percent redu@@ ction in mortality from heart disease -- remark@@ ably , 1.@@ 1 million dea@@ ths a@@ ver@@ ted every year .
well , there are probably three reasons .
we have just be@@ gun to try to figure out how do we take this very complex machine that does extraordinary kinds of information process@@ ing and use our own minds to understand this very complex brain that suppor@@ ts our own minds .
that is pre@@ cis@@ ely what we do today when we decide that everybody with one of these brain dis@@ orders , brain circu@@ it dis@@ orders , has a behavi@@ oral dis@@ order .
we were all excited to start , but the numbers hit us then : 200 million children between four to 14 that should be going to school , but do not ; 100 million children who go to school but cannot read ; 1@@ 25 million who cannot do basic ma@@ ths .
now , when you talk global you have to talk english .
that &apos;s absolute ho@@ g@@ was@@ h .
there is also this my@@ th that children from the sl@@ ums cannot inte@@ gra@@ te with main@@ stream .
we &apos;ve got the best school a@@ ward for three years suc@@ c@@ essi@@ vely .
i like eating . i like playing . &quot;
and howard is very interested in meas@@ uring things .
and that is , that when they analy@@ zed the diet pe@@ p@@ s@@ i data , they were asking the wrong question .
and , anyway , despite the fact that they were far super@@ ior in ad@@ her@@ ence , and the quality of their to@@ ma@@ to pa@@ ste , pre@@ go was strug@@ gling .
and today , if you go to the super@@ market , a really good one , and you look at how many ra@@ gu@@ s there are -- do you know how many they are ? 3@@ 6 !
in particular , they were obs@@ essed with the story of gre@@ y po@@ upon . right ?
you go to che@@ z pan@@ is@@ se , they give you the re@@ d-@@ tail s@@ as@@ him@@ i with ro@@ ast@@ ed pump@@ k@@ in see@@ ds in a something something redu@@ ction .
gene@@ tics has opened the door to the study of human vari@@ ability .
if you look up sub@@ clinical ac@@ ne , you may find a website , which i did , which says that this is the easi@@ est type of ac@@ ne to treat .
and that good news is that if you can survive to the end of my talk , which we &apos;ll see if that happens for everyone , you will be a pre-@@ vi@@ vor .
and that &apos;s actually true .
he wanted us instead to use these cheap car@@ d@@ board vie@@ wers so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be dama@@ ged .
but there &apos;s a middle ground , too .
and then another which em@@ ph@@ asi@@ zes the auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity of human experience -- and hon@@ est@@ y , and ra@@ w@@ ness .
and this tem@@ po@@ ral map was something that energi@@ zes modern com@@ ics , but i was wondering if perhaps it also energi@@ zes other sorts of forms , and i found some in history .
and i thought , o@@ .@@ k. , well , if that &apos;s true , is there any way , when we go beyond today &apos;s print , to somehow bring that back ?
i just want to get to the last pan@@ el .
so when i heard that the transl@@ ator , gre@@ g@@ ory rab@@ as@@ sa , had written his own book on the subject , i couldn &apos;t wait to read it .
now i &apos;m big on speaking to people &apos;s self-@@ interest because we &apos;re all wired for that .
this is the ex@@ act opposite of the way that an@@ ger and fear and pan@@ ic , all of the fli@@ ght-@@ or@@ -@@ fight respon@@ ses , operate .
com@@ e@@ dy has been cros@@ sing country with remarkable speed way before the internet , social media , even c@@ able tv .
shor@@ tly after the conference was over , jo@@ el got a requ@@ est for a sig@@ ned copy from the head of the ep@@ a in washington whose wall it now han@@ gs on .
and in western europe mostly try to stay away from any long-@@ distance relationships , big grou@@ p@@ ings , grou@@ p@@ ings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families .
so it may be good for the wa@@ i@@ st@@ line , but it probably won &apos;t keep you sa@@ ti@@ ated for very long .
they &apos;re -- every single thing about that fish has been changed .
how do you se@@ du@@ ce an open ocean cre@@ ature like that to sp@@ ill its secre@@ ts ?
the poor little mol@@ as coming in , getting ri@@ pped to sh@@ re@@ ds , so we head down south , to san die@@ go .
they &apos;re not big migr@@ ators . this is their track : we de@@ plo@@ yed the tag off of to@@ k@@ yo , and the mol@@ a in one month kind of got into the ku@@ ro@@ shi@@ o current off of japan and for@@ a@@ ged there .
and sure , it may be just one big old sil@@ ly fish , but it &apos;s helping .
and so you could see that as this dis@@ c ro@@ tat@@ es about this axis , it will create a dis@@ c of light that we can control .
us@@ man ri@@ a@@ z : yes , that was the first one . and then i -- that was the first thing i learned , and then i started pro@@ gr@@ ess@@ ing to other things .
ah@@ -@@ ha@@ h .
if you &apos;re in australia , it &apos;s mostly ab@@ origin@@ als who are in ja@@ il .

while universi@@ ties are trying to de@@ v@@ ise cour@@ ses in conflict resol@@ ution , and governments are trying to stop sk@@ ir@@ mis@@ hes at bor@@ ders , we are surro@@ unded by violence , whether it &apos;s road ra@@ ge , or whether it &apos;s dom@@ esti@@ c violence , whether it &apos;s a teacher be@@ ating up a student and killing her because she hasn &apos;t done her home@@ work , it &apos;s everywhere .
cause you &apos;re either a vic@@ tim , or on top , like me .
there are more people being ra@@ ped . there are more wars .
and if somebody answers , that shall be my wish . &quot;
he built this machine , and we had a beautiful demon@@ stration of how this thing really works , with these little bits . and it &apos;s an idea that goes way back .
the guy who was supposed to build this machine was the guy in the middle , v@@ la@@ di@@ mir z@@ wor@@ y@@ k@@ in , from r@@ ca .
they actually used 6@@ j@@ 6 , the common radio tube , because they found they were more reli@@ able than the more expensive tu@@ bes .
&quot; no use , went home . &quot;
that &apos;s two thousand cy@@ cles per second -- &quot; yes , i &apos;m chicken &quot; -- so two kil@@ o@@ cy@@ cles was slow speed .
and he saw everything in terms of -- he could read the bin@@ ary code straight off the machine .
and he went out of his way to say that he was not saying this was life@@ like , or a new kind of life .
and all our computers have , inside them , the cop@@ ies of the architecture that he had to just design one day , sort of on pen@@ cil and paper .
your child will live a life ten years yo@@ unger than you because of the landscape of food that we &apos;ve built around them .

fast food has taken over the whole country ; we know that .

if you &apos;re an accoun@@ t@@ ant , and a bo@@ x-@@ ti@@ cker , the only thing you can do in these circum@@ stances is buy che@@ aper sh@@ it .

you know , there &apos;s your week .
it &apos;s the future . it &apos;s the only way .
but the home needs to start pas@@ sing on cooking again , for sure .
when i was in hun@@ t@@ ington , trying to get a few things to work when they weren &apos;t , i thought &quot; if i had a magic wand , what would i do ? &quot; and i thought , &quot; you know what ?
put on a black arm@@ band , or cra@@ ck open the cham@@ pagne ? &quot;
but in order to try and explain the whole thing , i would need another 18 minutes or so to do it , so you &apos;re just going to have to take it on trust from me on this occasi@@ on , and let me as@@ sure you that all of these issues are involved in cyber@@ security and control of the internet one way or the other , but in a con@@ figu@@ ration that even ste@@ phen ha@@ w@@ king would probably have diffic@@ ul@@ ty trying to get his head around .
cyber@@ crimin@@ als would go there to buy and sell stol@@ en credit card details , to exchange information about new mal@@ ware that was out there .
he was out there on the town having a fa@@ b time enjo@@ ying the high life .
ma@@ x vision was one of the best pen@@ et@@ ration te@@ sters working out of s@@ ant@@ a c@@ lar@@ a , california in the late 9@@ 0s for private companies and volun@@ t@@ arily for the f@@ bi .
and let me be bl@@ unt about this .
so stri@@ ctly from a climate change perspective , the cities are already relatively green .
since 2000 , already two-@@ thir@@ ds of house@@ holds in sub@@ ur@@ bia we just haven &apos;t caught up with the actual reali@@ ties of this .
this was a little gro@@ cer@@ y store , a food li@@ on gro@@ cer@@ y store , that is now a public library .
eventually , i expect that the streets will probably ex@@ tend through a re@@ development of the m@@ all .
it &apos;s very successful , and it &apos;s helped to pro@@ mp@@ t -- eight of the 13 regi@@ onal m@@ alls in den@@ ver have now , or have announ@@ ced plans to be , retro@@ fit@@ ted .
the cre@@ ek had been cul@@ ver@@ ted under the par@@ king lot .
their popu@@ lations are more diver@@ se than typical sub@@ ur@@ bia , but they &apos;re less diver@@ se than cities .
i intervie@@ wed a high-@@ powered busin@@ ess@@ woman ; she told me she didn &apos;t have time .
there &apos;s po@@ w@@ der@@ -@@ box , der@@ ri@@ ere , a po@@ o@@ ky , a po@@ o@@ ch@@ y , a po@@ op@@ y , a po@@ op@@ alo@@ o , a po@@ on@@ in@@ ana , a pa@@ de@@ pa@@ ch@@ et@@ ch@@ ki , a po@@ w , and a pe@@ ach .
and every single time i did the show at the beginning , women would literally line up after the show because they wanted to tell me their stories .
i have seen terrible , terrible , terrible violence .
and i watched her walk up on stage in her red short d@@ ress , and high he@@ els , and she stood there and she said , &quot; my name is mar@@ sh@@ a .
and i actually made up a little character whose name was mr . alli@@ g@@ ator , and i would call him up when things got really bad , and i would say it was time to come and pick me up .
maybe it &apos;s because my na@@ tive state of south car@@ ol@@ ina , which is not much smaller than pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day h@@ ung@@ ary , once imag@@ ined a future for itself as an independent country .
the night wat@@ ch@@ man , seeing how things were going and wa@@ x@@ ing indi@@ g@@ nant , said , &quot; well , we &apos;re going to call the police , aren &apos;t we ? &quot;
the white ma@@ yo@@ r vis@@ ited mr . tes@@ z@@ ler and said , &quot; mr . tes@@ z@@ ler , i trust you &apos;re going to be hir@@ ing a lot of white workers . &quot;
and on the first occasi@@ on that i vis@@ ited his house , he gave me honor of deci@@ ding what piece of music we would listen to .
they would not leave me alone until i let them have a piece , but it was not a good one . &quot;
ben dun@@ la@@ p : the life@@ -@@ long lear@@ ner
ta@@ pe@@ stri@@ es effectively provi@@ ded a vast can@@ v@@ as on which the pat@@ r@@ ons of the day could de@@ pic@@ t the hero@@ es with whom they wanted to be associated , or even themselves , and in addition to that , ta@@ pe@@ stri@@ es were hu@@ gely expensive .
that was an interesting case .
i frequ@@ ently go out into the hall and the g@@ aller@@ ies and i watch our vis@@ it@@ ors coming in .
p@@ at mit@@ ch@@ ell : and this is your hospital . this is the inside .
they were the leaders , and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations .
for me , my mother was prepar@@ ing &#91; me &#93; when i was a child to become a doctor , but i really didn &apos;t want to .
they do everything for them .
if you compare nasa &apos;s an@@ nu@@ al budget to explore the hea@@ v@@ ens , that one-@@ year budget would fund no@@ a@@ a &apos;s budget to explore the oceans for 1,@@ 600 years .
no , no , that &apos;s the only place a ship &apos;s been .
but if you were to put it on an equal area proje@@ ction , you &apos;d see that the mi@@ d-@@ ocean ri@@ dge co@@ vers 23 percent of the earth &apos;s total surface area .
it &apos;s not a flo@@ od , it was pus@@ hed up there .
no mouth , no gut , no di@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve system .
so life was much more creative than we had ever thought .
all their organ@@ ics are perfectly preser@@ ved . we begin to ex@@ ca@@ v@@ ate them .
a discovery is made , that discovery is inst@@ antly seen in the comm@@ and center a second later .
you can put so much information into that mind , it &apos;s in full &#91; recei@@ ving &#93; mode .
only a little over half of recent college gradu@@ ates in the united states who get a higher education actually are working in jobs that require that education .
ni@@ ck par@@ lan@@ te : for each pi@@ x@@ el in the image , set the red to zero .
so these students were really getting something meaning@@ ful for their investment of time and effort .
and of course these simple re@@ tri@@ ev@@ al questions are not the end of the story .
what you see here is a self-@@ gener@@ ated map from students in our prin@@ c@@ et@@ on soci@@ ology 10@@ 1 course , where they have put themselves on a world map , and you can really see the global reach of this kind of effort .
so andre@@ w and his students went in , looked at some of those as@@ sign@@ ments , understood the ro@@ ot cause of the mis@@ con@@ ception , and then they produced a tar@@ ge@@ ted er@@ ror message that would be provi@@ ded to every student whose answer fell into that bu@@ cket , which means that students who made that same mistake would now get person@@ alized feedback telling them how to fix their mis@@ con@@ ception much more effectively .
so let &apos;s go back even further , to plu@@ tar@@ ch , who said that , &quot; the mind is not a ves@@ sel that needs fil@@ ling , but wood that needs ig@@ ni@@ ting . &quot;
for those of you who i &apos;ll be fortun@@ ate enough to meet after@@ wards , you could please re@@ fra@@ in from saying , &quot; oh my god , you &apos;re so much shor@@ ter in real life . &quot;
or this ad that i read in the new york times : &quot; wearing a fine watch spea@@ ks lou@@ dly of your r@@ ank in society .
and as david lee ro@@ th san@@ g in &quot; just a gi@@ gol@@ o , &quot; &quot; i a@@ in &apos;t got no body . &quot;
and a@@ yn rand of course , a@@ yn rand is famous for a philosoph@@ y called obje@@ c@@ ti@@ vis@@ m , which refle@@ cts another value of new@@ ton@@ ian physics , which is obje@@ c@@ tivity .
when people i knew , you know , people who considered themselves liber@@ al , and everything else , were making fun of jen@@ ni@@ fer flo@@ wers and pau@@ la j@@ ones .
but then i read in &quot; de@@ ar ab@@ by &quot; that that was ru@@ de .
and you know people , this is the problem with quote , obje@@ c@@ tivity , un@@ quote .
the tri@@ ck@@ ster has a mind that is prepared for the un@@ prepared .
i still have a way to go .
it &apos;s an actual thing .
can we run that , andre@@ w ?
you ought to be able to go to a psychi@@ at@@ r@@ ist or a psych@@ ologist , and put down your 10@@ -@@ dollar cop@@ ay , and get treated , just like you do when you got a cut on your arm . it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
if we want humanity to last forever , we have to col@@ oni@@ ze the mil@@ ky way .
there &apos;s been an experiment for the last four or five years on the geor@@ ges bank , or the grand ban@@ ks off of new@@ fo@@ und@@ land . it &apos;s a no@@ -@@ take fishing zone .
number six : biot@@ e@@ ch disaster .
there &apos;s going to be a lot of cheap rock@@ e@@ try that &apos;s going to come online in about six or seven years that gets us into the low atmosphere very che@@ ap@@ ly .
number three -- isn &apos;t this stuff cool ?
and now , if you went into one of those conven@@ tions and you said , &quot; well , i don &apos;t think black holes are out there , &quot; they &apos;d ho@@ ot you off the stage .
a small astero@@ id , say a half mile wide , would touch off fire@@ stor@@ ms followed by sever@@ e global cool@@ ing from the de@@ br@@ is ki@@ cked up -- car@@ l sa@@ gan &apos;s nuclear winter thing .
you &apos;ll notice that a lot of com@@ ets are named after people you never heard of , ama@@ te@@ ur astronom@@ ers ? that &apos;s because nobody &apos;s looking for them , except ama@@ te@@ urs .
we &apos;re in 17@@ th century japan on the west coast , and a little , wi@@ zen@@ ed mon@@ k is hur@@ rying along , near mid@@ night , to the c@@ rest of a small h@@ ill .
it &apos;s not the ku@@ ril ar@@ c . it &apos;s not even the entire pacific .
that &apos;s our challenge , is to understand , understand this system in new and phenomen@@ al ways .
and it wasn &apos;t easy . it wasn &apos;t easy in those days .
you can see the cop@@ per ti@@ ps on these things .
here &apos;s what this system is going to look like that we are fund@@ ed to build at this point .
just as you move , it gener@@ ates power .
they e@@ je@@ ct it to the surface where it flo@@ ats , and it is picked up by an autonom@@ ous airplane , and it &apos;s brought back to the laboratory within 24 hours of the er@@ up@@ tion .
you see how resi@@ stant it is to those very ideas .
and it is that belief that i think dri@@ ves society .
it is actually a living connection to the co@@ s@@ mic event that we are part of , and a story that is certainly on@@ going .
so the important thing actually , is to introduce the actual architec@@ tural dimensions , which might be totally in@@ ex@@ plic@@ able in words , because they operate in propor@@ tions , in materials , in light .
the political is not an ene@@ my of architecture .
so not the habit@@ ual architecture that inst@@ ills in us the fal@@ se sort of st@@ ability , but an architecture that is full of ten@@ sion , an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human sou@@ l and a human heart , and that brea@@ ks out of the sha@@ ck@@ les of hab@@ its .
but i rather play something completely un@@ heard of , and even with fla@@ ws , than repe@@ at the same thing over and over which has been hol@@ lo@@ wed by its meaning@@ less@@ ness .
risks of spaces that have never been so di@@ zz@@ ying , as they should be , for a pi@@ one@@ ering city .
there are emotions of the vic@@ ti@@ ms .
dan@@ iel li@@ bes@@ kind buil@@ ds on very big ideas . here , he shares 17 words that under@@ lie his vision for architecture -- ra@@ w , ris@@ ky , emotional , radical -- and that offer inspiration for any b@@ old creative pur@@ suit .
and then it also has the lo@@ west dra@@ g co@@ efficient of any car of its size .
and so i think we &apos;re making progress in that direction , and i feel confi@@ dent that we &apos;ll get there .
but in a gall@@ on of gas@@ ol@@ ine , you have , effectively , thousands of years of sun power comp@@ ressed into a small space , so it &apos;s hard to make the numbers work right now on solar , and to re@@ mot@@ ely compe@@ te with , for example , natural gas , fra@@ cked natural gas . how are you going to build a business here ?
em : well , essentially , solar@@ city rais@@ es a ch@@ un@@ k of capital from say , a company or a bank .
and they &apos;d look at me , like , &quot; is he serious ? &quot;
the space shu@@ ttle was an attemp@@ t at a re@@ us@@ able ro@@ cket , but even the main t@@ ank of the space shu@@ ttle was thro@@ wn away every time , and the parts that were re@@ us@@ able took a 10@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ person group nine months to re@@ fur@@ bis@@ h for flight .
all right , let &apos;s see that video then , because this is actually amazing when you think about it .
it &apos;s really counter@@ intui@@ tive .
they love nam@@ i@@ bia for its beautiful dun@@ es , that are even t@@ aller than the em@@ pi@@ re state building .
between 196@@ 6 and 199@@ 0 , the u.s. and so@@ vi@@ et interests f@@ ought for control over my country .
the head@@ man said : &quot; yes . our po@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
the best one , like my father -- i &apos;m not campaig@@ ning for my father -- they were put in charge to stop others from po@@ ach@@ ing .
what started as very small , community ran@@ gers getting community involved , has now grown into something that we call conser@@ van@@ cies .
i want to know how i impact them .
i might still be in the green list , but i &apos;m not doing myself , or you , or the oceans any favor@@ s .
jam@@ ie oli@@ ver is campaig@@ ning to save america from the way we eat .
a couple things happened .
i expect a lot from food .
but it is more than just a re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory of our resources ; it &apos;s also the global geogra@@ ph@@ y of the comm@@ union we call dinner .
all of that , stri@@ p it away . in the world of the arc@@ tic and al@@ p@@ ine environments , where the ice is , it &apos;s real and it &apos;s present .
we &apos;ve got 3@@ 3 c@@ ameras out this moment .
it &apos;s been a re@@ mor@@ sel@@ ess , ste@@ ad@@ y increase .
now we turn on our time lap@@ se .
that &apos;s where it started .
or if you take an american re@@ ference , to the u.s. capit@@ ol building and you pack 3,000 capit@@ ol buildings into that block , it would be equivalent to how large that block was .
and for the last four years , my co@@ auth@@ or phan@@ ish pur@@ an@@ am and i spent investig@@ ating this top@@ ic .
and specifically , there are four types of invisible innovation that are coming out of india .
what happens when you put hundreds of thousands of smart , young , ambi@@ ti@@ ous kids on a call center job ?
as many of you know , ib@@ m has always been considered for the last hundred years to be one of the most innovative companies .
it is four in the morning . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t die on den@@ ch &apos;s birth@@ day .
and how far down into it you figure we &apos;ll have to sc@@ roll to get to the gol@@ den ti@@ cket ?
and once we get involved in the ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic decisions , again either personally or with our loved ones and family members , we also very quickly learn the benefits , the tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s and the limit@@ ations of these tools .
importantly , those special proteins are among the most highly char@@ ged objects in our body .
10 years ago , dr . pal@@ ti fo@@ unded a company called no@@ vo@@ cure to develop his discovery into a practical therapy for patients .
he received surgery .
it &apos;s still there .
in the lab , we &apos;ve obser@@ ved tremendous sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ es between che@@ mo@@ therapy and tumor tre@@ ating fields .
this is a new work , it &apos;s a new program .
in fact they go 15 feet deep , and collect rain water from roof , there is a small pi@@ pe , and from their cour@@ ty@@ ard .
so , water from 300 , 400 kilometers away , soon it become like this .
somewhere a stream or a ri@@ v@@ u@@ let is running through here .
this is called k@@ und . we have , in english , surface water and ground water .
and you have to go further down .
these are the beautiful sta@@ irs which we just saw in one of the sli@@ des .
and hiv infe@@ ction rates are down 27 percent : 6@@ 00,000 less people a year are getting hiv in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
we hear a lot about china , and they do l@@ end a lot of money , but 60 percent of the f@@ di in the last couple of years has come from europe , america , australia , canada .
today , sub-@@ sahar@@ a is at the levels that tur@@ key and mexico were at in 197@@ 5 .
when you &apos;re poor , corruption is not your biggest pri@@ ority .
this is indian growth from 1960 to 2010 .
you can go and down@@ load some of the great african liter@@ ature from the internet now .
the cyber@@ top@@ i@@ ans say , much like fa@@ x machines and x@@ ero@@ x machines did in the &apos; 8@@ 0s , blogs and social networks have radi@@ cally trans@@ formed the economics of pro@@ test , so people would ine@@ vi@@ t@@ ably re@@ bel .
so what happened is that a 24@@ -year-old man , a chinese man , died in prison cu@@ sto@@ dy .
well , great . you are the one who is to bl@@ ame . &quot;
so it does play a social role , however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement .
it didn &apos;t matter what she was cr@@ ying about , she could get on my k@@ nee , she could s@@ not my sle@@ e@@ ve up , just cry , cry it out .
and this is a man who , 10 minutes ago , had just put his teen@@ age son in the ground -- something i just can &apos;t even imagine .
that &apos;s what the si@@ sters said , &quot; he was fine . &quot;
he told me to go in his room .
we kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
the americans have even recogni@@ zed it , in an agre@@ ement .
in fact , those 15 million cell@@ phones are the most connections that any country , including the u.s. and china , has ever establi@@ shed in the history of tele@@ communic@@ ations .
and it &apos;s the best thing and the most nutri@@ ti@@ ous and re@@ fres@@ hing thing you can drink on a hot day in the tro@@ pic@@ s , so i said sure .
you know what was india &apos;s biggest as@@ set in afghanistan in the last seven years ?
the story re@@ sts on a fundamental platform of political pl@@ ur@@ alism .
and those of you who cas@@ hed your money here might be surprised to see how many scri@@ p@@ ts there are on the ru@@ pe@@ e note , sp@@ elling out the den@@ om@@ in@@ ations .
so as we were sun@@ ba@@ thing , my best friend next to me says , &quot; man , why doesn &apos;t somebody inv@@ ent something that you can just put on your skin and then you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the ? &quot;
anyway , we realized that we could save 80 million li@@ ters of water on average each time they ski@@ pped a bat@@ h , and also we would save two hours a day for kids who are in rural areas , two hours more for school , two hours more for home@@ work , two hours more to just be a kid .
it &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
you &apos;ll notice they all lived , the ones on the top line -- that &apos;s a 100 percent survival rate .
we ad@@ ore babies because they &apos;re so c@@ ute .
it was a hyper@@ stimul@@ us for them , and they loved it .
dan den@@ nett : c@@ ute , sex@@ y , swe@@ et , funny
they just quite happ@@ ily show their ma@@ ster@@ piece to who@@ ever wants to look at it .
and i for@@ got to bring one up with me .
all right . so the rest of you can save them for when i say something particularly bor@@ ing , and then you can fire at me .
now , they &apos;ll certainly -- when they come across something new , they &apos;ll certainly ask , &quot; what is it ? &quot;
15 ? 20 ? anybody get all 30 ?
it &apos;s basically the same thing as the 30 cir@@ cles thing that i just had you do .
and of course , they used experim@@ entation in all aspe@@ cts of their work , from films to buildings , from games to graphi@@ cs .
so when designers are working on ideas , they can start building stuff whenever they want .
research into kids &apos; behavior actually suggests that it &apos;s worth taking ro@@ le-@@ playing seriously .
we &apos;re doing the same thing as designers .
and if we &apos;re running design studi@@ os we need to be able to figure out , how can we transition designers through these different experiences ?
but then i stopped , because i figured , &quot; oh , you know , i made it .
he said , &quot; no . but it can buy pro@@ za@@ c . &quot;
so here is to your continu@@ ed success .
in my entire life i had seen in black and white , and suddenly everything was in sho@@ cking techni@@ color .
and l@@ o and beh@@ old , people started u@@ plo@@ ading their videos .
i &apos;ll stop it there in the interest of time .
and we just closed sub@@ mis@@ sions janu@@ ary 10@@ th , and our final t@@ ally was 2,@@ 0@@ 5@@ 1 videos from 5@@ 8 different countries .
but , i know myself too , i feel this virtual es@@ pr@@ it de cor@@ ps , if you will , with all of them .
what i can do and what i would like to do with you is give you , like that ini@@ tial question , a set of questions to figure out for yourself , layer by layer , like pe@@ el@@ ing an oni@@ on , getting at the core of what you believe is moral or im@@ moral per@@ su@@ asi@@ on .
it is a technology that em@@ power@@ s the individual to deter@@ mine its own life course , to shape itself .
for ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le , eth@@ ics was not about the question , is that still good , or is it bad ?
even something as inno@@ cu@@ ous as a set of school cha@@ irs is a per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve technology .
se@@ ba@@ stian deter@@ ding : what your designs say about you
students learn best when they &apos;re ac@@ tively practic@@ ing .
and finally , from teach for america , i learned that a class is not pri@@ mar@@ ily about information .
and man@@ tis sh@@ ri@@ mp are called &quot; man@@ tis sh@@ ri@@ mp &quot; after the pra@@ ying man@@ ti@@ ses , which also have a fast fe@@ eding app@@ en@@ da@@ ge . and i started to think , well , maybe it will be interesting , while listening to their sounds , to figure out how these animals generate very fast fe@@ eding stri@@ kes .
so we got this incredible video system . it &apos;s very new technology -- it just came out about a year ago -- that allows you to film at extremely high spee@@ ds in low light .
and so i thought that this was sort of the end of the story .
now , it &apos;s also known to architec@@ ts . one of the most famous architec@@ ts is edu@@ ardo cat@@ al@@ an@@ o , who popul@@ ari@@ zed this structure .
but that was not the end of the story .
you can see it coming in , and an incredible flas@@ h of light , and all this ca@@ vi@@ tation spre@@ ading over the surface of the sna@@ il .
and so i &apos;m very curious about whether those col@@ ored dots in the center of the sa@@ dd@@ les are con@@ ve@@ ying some kind of information about their ability to stri@@ ke , or their stri@@ ke force , and something about the time period in the mol@@ ting cycle .
but it &apos;s a question of perception , and if that &apos;s what you &apos;re thinking , if that &apos;s what you think i mean when i say , &quot; this is an ocean planet stu@@ pi@@ dly called &apos; earth . &apos; &quot; if you think that that &apos;s the relative importance , two to one , you &apos;re wrong by a factor of ten .
it &apos;s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers ; we take all our ter@@ re@@ stri@@ al h@@ ang@@ -@@ u@@ ps , all our con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts -- importantly , these two-@@ dimensional con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts that we have , and they &apos;re so con@@ stra@@ ined we don &apos;t even understand it -- and we take them under@@ water .
and just notice how she roll@@ s under and turns ; she doesn &apos;t sit there and try and b@@ low air into a t@@ ank and kind of flow up or sin@@ k down -- she just roll@@ s .
i don &apos;t really look that ug@@ ly , but the camera is so close that it &apos;s just di@@ stor@@ ted .
where the hell that goes , i don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s a lot of fun .
and the core idea of o@@ y@@ ster@@ -@@ te@@ c@@ ture is to har@@ ness the biological power of mus@@ sel@@ s , e@@ el@@ gr@@ ass and o@@ y@@ sters -- species that live in the h@@ arb@@ or -- and , at the same time , har@@ ness the power of people who live in the community towards making change now .
so we were inspired by the o@@ y@@ ster , but i was also inspired by the life cycle of the o@@ y@@ ster .
and also showing o@@ y@@ ster gar@@ den@@ ing for the community along its ed@@ ges .
so , you would just walk around london at this point and just be over@@ wh@@ el@@ med with this sten@@ ch .
s@@ now lived near there , heard about the out@@ break , and in this amazing act of coura@@ ge went directly into the bel@@ ly of the be@@ ast because he thought an out@@ break that concent@@ r@@ ated could actually poten@@ tially end up convin@@ cing people that , in fact , the real men@@ ace of chol@@ era was in the water supply and not in the air .
and so that in a way is the ulti@@ mate leg@@ acy of this map .
and it really impres@@ sed me -- i met him two weeks after he got out of prison -- that he went through that experience , and ended up with the de@@ mean@@ or that he had .
and if you think about this man , 4@@ 6 years later , still sti@@ cking to this non-@@ violent response to a sever@@ e political and human rights issue .
i wish they would just go away .
he lives in this lo@@ g cab@@ in -- no running water , no heat other than -- no windows and high-@@ speed internet connection .
and he hadn &apos;t seen a computer before we did this movie . we taught him photo@@ shop and -- yeah , we can play it .
we think there &apos;s on the order -- visible to the hu@@ b@@ ble space telescop@@ e , if you had the time to scan it around -- about 100 billion galaxies . right ?
and so that &apos;s the sort of sequence , and so i have a more arti@@ stic impres@@ sion of this .
what kind of evidence do we have for that ?
so we &apos;re going to go out and s@@ wing around and look back at this .
and you &apos;ll see there are all these fil@@ am@@ ents and structures and vo@@ ids .
you see a fil@@ am@@ ent , you see the light is the invisible matter , and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up .
and you see how the dark matter l@@ um@@ ps up , and the ordinary matter just tra@@ ils along behind .
we want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe we can see whether there are any non-@@ lin@@ ear effects that are starting to move , to modi@@ fy , and are giving us a hin@@ t about how spac@@ e-@@ time itself was actually created at the beginning moments .
that &apos;s really not how it has to be .
fort@@ y-@@ seven percent .
and before we know it , right , we &apos;re an@@ xi@@ ous about feeling an@@ xi@@ ous .
and eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like ta@@ d@@ po@@ les , because of the sha@@ ke .
and it didn &apos;t make any sense , because i was finally able to support my art , and yet i was crea@@ tively blan@@ k .
so i organized c@@ and@@ les on a table , i li@@ t them , and then ble@@ w them out , then repe@@ ated this process over and over with the same set of c@@ and@@ les , then assem@@ bled the videos into the larger image .
phi@@ l han@@ sen : embra@@ ce the sha@@ ke
now around cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , there are sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ed g@@ ho@@ st villa@@ ges , e@@ er@@ ily sil@@ ent , str@@ angel@@ y char@@ ming , bu@@ co@@ lic , totally cont@@ am@@ in@@ ated .
the world health organization puts the number of cher@@ no@@ by@@ l-@@ related dea@@ ths at 4@@ ,000 , eventually .
just a moment ago , my daughter re@@ bec@@ ca tex@@ ted me for good lu@@ ck .
some of the things we do now with our devices are things that , only a few years ago , we would have found od@@ d or dist@@ ur@@ bing , but they &apos;ve quickly come to seem familiar , just how we do things .
but then he st@@ ops himself and he says , &quot; you know , i &apos;m not telling you the truth .
for kids growing up , that sk@@ ill is the bedro@@ ck of development .
and as that woman took comfort in her robot comp@@ ani@@ on , i didn &apos;t find it amazing ; i found it one of the most wr@@ en@@ ching , complicated moments in my 15 years of work .
we use technology to define ourselves by sharing our thoughts and feelings even as we &apos;re having them .
but it &apos;s not , it &apos;s early days .
we &apos;re dra@@ wn to virtual roman@@ ce , to computer games that seem like worl@@ ds , to the idea that robots , robots , will some@@ day be our true comp@@ ani@@ ons .
i &apos;m sure at the time he did that , i didn &apos;t -- it didn &apos;t -- well , somewhere , i guess in the hidden rec@@ esses of mind , it po@@ pped out years later .
a doctor si@@ ts bes@@ i@@ de him , whose quick ste@@ ad@@ y hand may men@@ d a bone , or stem the life@@ -@@ blood &apos;s flow .
i believe you should be on time . but i felt at practice , for example , we start on time , we close on time .
they think all change is progress .
re@@ minds me of another set of thre@@ es that my dad tried to get across to us .
but i &apos;d want one that could play , too .
john woo@@ den : the difference between w@@ inning and succe@@ eding
we could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body .
so that &apos;s actually now in patients .
and we now have been able just to show the creation of human li@@ ver tissue just this past month using this technology .
we then are able to actually image those , do 3@@ 60 degree ro@@ tation to analy@@ ze the kid@@ ney in its full volu@@ me@@ tri@@ c characteri@@ stics , and we then are able to actually take this information and then scan this in a prin@@ ting compu@@ teri@@ zed form .
i was missing school . it was pretty much mis@@ er@@ able .
i was a little kid , and i was like , &quot; yeah . i &apos;ll have that . i &apos;ll have that surgery . &quot;
now i &apos;d love to watch the first movie again as sort of a war@@ m@@ -up to the sequ@@ el coming out next week .
now i &apos;d like to say i wo@@ ke up one morning and said , &quot; i &apos;m going to write about collabor@@ ative consumption , &quot; but actually it was a complicated web of seem@@ ingly dis@@ connected ideas .
well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head , until actually i realized it was happening because of four key dri@@ vers .
and that can be anything from baby goods to fashi@@ ons to -- how many of you have a power dri@@ ll , own a power dri@@ ll ? right .
i believe also , our generation , our relationship to satis@@ fying what we want is far less tan@@ gi@@ ble than any other previous generation .
i &apos;m on a mission to make sharing hi@@ p .
and there was this specific tri@@ be that was really afraid of this other lu@@ hy@@ a tri@@ be .
i &apos;m leaving america . i &apos;m going to run for office . &quot;
trees were thro@@ wn against the house , the windows explo@@ ded .
i &apos;ll make a facebook account . can you print fli@@ ers for the neighbor@@ ho@@ ods ?

this is the cur@@ ve for j@@ op@@ lin .
emergen@@ cy prepar@@ e@@ dness is a big deal in disaster re@@ co@@ very because it makes to@@ w@@ ns sa@@ fer and more resili@@ ent .
this is ho@@ sin@@ ia , the largest and most ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zed fa@@ vel@@ a in rio de jan@@ ei@@ r@@ o .

&apos;@@ this place is very addi@@ ctive , &apos; he had said .
they &apos;re quite vi@@ tal places , these communities .
and sometimes they have natural tr@@ as@@ h-@@ dis@@ pos@@ al .
this woman is nine , which means &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; in tur@@ k@@ ish .
it &apos;s an interaction between volunte@@ ers , passionate inv@@ ent@@ ors and technology , and it &apos;s a story that many other blind people could tell .
but sa@@ dly , her health hasn &apos;t per@@ mit@@ ted her to come today .
for example , i was too sh@@ y then , and i &apos;m actually too sh@@ y now , to ask anybody to read me out l@@ oud sex@@ ually ex@@ plic@@ it material .
but i wouldn &apos;t give up the technology , because it &apos;s allowed me to lead a great life .
i wonder what the future will hold .
right now , those and other neuro@@ lo@@ gic diseases -- for which we have no cure or pre@@ ven@@ tion -- cost about a third of a trilli@@ on dollars a year .
gre@@ g@@ ory pe@@ t@@ sk@@ o : the coming neuro@@ logi@@ cal epidemic
this gives us the chance to imagine an entirely different kind of society , a society where the cre@@ ators and the disco@@ ver@@ ers and the per@@ form@@ ers and the inno@@ v@@ ators come together with their pat@@ r@@ ons and their finan@@ ci@@ ers to talk about issues , enter@@ tain , en@@ ligh@@ ten , pro@@ vo@@ ke each other . &quot;
there are a set of socie@@ tal challenges that i &apos;m actually not that worried about , and they &apos;re cap@@ tured by images like this .
the economic play@@ book is surpris@@ ingly clear , surpris@@ ingly stra@@ ig@@ ht@@ forward , in the short term especially .
to give just one example , there are about five million americans who have been un@@ emplo@@ yed for at least six months .
and i &apos;m very aware that when you say the word &quot; god , &quot; many people will turn off immediately .
the only appropriate response would be a com@@ passionate sil@@ ence and some kind of practical help .
over the last few weeks i have been stru@@ ck by the number of times that words in our wor@@ ship have felt a bit in@@ appropriate , a bit do@@ d@@ g@@ y .
does god demand lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty , like any medi@@ ev@@ al ty@@ rant ?
maybe god isn &apos;t an ag@@ ent like all of us are ag@@ ents .
i don &apos;t know .
thank you .
so , another way to think about technology , what it means , is to imagine a world without technology .
so , what technology brought , through the very simple tools like these stone tools here -- even something as small as this -- the early b@@ ands of humans were actually able to elimin@@ ate to extin@@ ction about 250 me@@ g@@ af@@ a@@ un@@ a animals in north america when they first arrived 10,000 years ago .
it &apos;s a very , very strong force .
and there are things moving towards greater complexity , moving towards greater diversity , moving towards greater speci@@ alization , sen@@ ti@@ ence , u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity and most important , evol@@ v@@ ability : those very same things are also present in technology .
that &apos;s what progress is about .
that &apos;s actually my son , right here .
nei@@ l and i were sitting there compar@@ ing how little we &apos;ve sle@@ pt in anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion for this . i &apos;ve never been so nervous -- and i do this when i &apos;m nervous , i just realized .
so when i moved back to san francisco , we r@@ ented this building .
up at the top , you see the e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch display , which is the black colum@@ n there for everyday use for your e@@ ye@@ pat@@ ch , and then you have the pa@@ ste@@ l and other colors for ste@@ pping out at night -- special occasi@@ ons , bar mit@@ z@@ va@@ h@@ s and whatever .
the goal was to have a one-@@ to-@@ one ra@@ ti@@ o with every one of these students .
a bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community .
because what about the students that wouldn &apos;t come to you , necessarily , who don &apos;t have really active parents that are bringing them in , or aren &apos;t close enough ? &quot; so then we started saying , &quot; well , we &apos;ve got 1,@@ 400 people on our tu@@ tor ro@@ ster .
you can see am@@ y tan spon@@ sor@@ ed the next one , &quot; i might get somewhere . &quot;
so the store actually did really well .
so then , the secret door -- this is one of the shel@@ ves you don &apos;t see when you walk in , but it slowly op@@ ens .
he &apos;s ev@@ ange@@ li@@ cal about it . he brings his cou@@ s@@ ins in now .
hot studio did a great job in a very ti@@ ght de@@ ad@@ line . so , visit the site .
this is not a story of a nam@@ eless survi@@ vor of war , and nam@@ eless re@@ fu@@ ge@@ es , whose ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ ical images we see in our new@@ spa@@ pers and our tv with tat@@ ter@@ ed clo@@ th@@ es , dir@@ ty face , sc@@ ared eyes .
she said , &quot; but it &apos;s not fair , because there is only one life , and there should only be one death . &quot;
we are missing the story of ne@@ hi@@ a , a pal@@ est@@ ini@@ an woman in ga@@ za who , the minute there was a ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire in the last year &apos;s war , she left out of home , colle@@ cted all the fl@@ our and bak@@ ed as much bread for every neighb@@ or to have , in case there is no ce@@ as@@ e-@@ fire the day after .
there is no way we can talk about a la@@ sting peace , building of democracy , sustainable econom@@ ies , any kind of stabili@@ ties , if we do not fully inclu@@ de women at the negoti@@ ating table .
when the sou@@ l lies down in that gr@@ ass , the world is too full to talk about .
so , i went to the cape last summer to hi@@ de from simpli@@ city , and i went to the gap , because i only have black pants .
we &apos;re human beings : we love complex things .
thank you .
so , i &apos;ve always been goo@@ gling this word , &quot; human , &quot; to find out how many hits i get .
i &apos;ve been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things , and so i made all this kind of stuff that mess@@ es with your eyes .
i was concerned with con@@ temporary art that was all about p@@ is@@ s , and sort of really sad things , and so i wanted to think about something happy .
end of story .
str@@ angel@@ y , not the big pi@@ le . so , i think it &apos;s as simple as this .
so , as you get older , you may , like , have kids , whatever .
and we have one .
&quot; they were the best of times , they were the worst of times &quot; : the most famous opening sentence in english liter@@ ature . i want to share brie@@ fly a tale of two planets . earth and ven@@ us are exactly the same size . earth &apos;s diam@@ e@@ ter is about 400 kilometers larger , but essentially the same size .
the developing countries are now following us and acceler@@ ating their p@@ ace . and actually , their cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 196@@ 5 . and they &apos;re cat@@ ching up very dra@@ matically . the total concent@@ ra@@ tions : by 20@@ 25 , they will be essentially where we were in 198@@ 5 .
lot of other things contribu@@ ted to it , but the new prime minister announ@@ ced that his very first pri@@ ority would be to change australia &apos;s position on k@@ yo@@ to , and he has . now , they came to an awareness par@@ tly because of the horri@@ ble dr@@ ought that they have had .
you have no idea .
we , most of us here , are americans . we have a democracy .
other people are not as el@@ a@@ stic .
this kind of al@@ phab@@ et sou@@ p is a new way to mark proteins -- not only by color but literally by al@@ phab@@ et letters .
this is sym@@ bio@@ tic@@ a , and they &apos;ve been working -- they were the first ones to do this in-@@ vi@@ tr@@ o meat -- and now they &apos;ve also done an in-@@ vi@@ tr@@ o co@@ at , a lea@@ ther co@@ at .
and this is the work of several designers that really en@@ h@@ ance the idea of soli@@ tude and expan@@ sion by means of various techniques .
again , this commun@@ al sense of experience that seems to be so important today .
eli@@ o c@@ ac@@ ca@@ v@@ ale : he took the idea of those doll@@ s that explain leu@@ ke@@ mi@@ a .
there was data within the stre@@ ams of news that we consu@@ me .
this ble@@ w our mind .
so we look at a process of group dynam@@ ics : co@@ al@@ es@@ c@@ ence and frag@@ ment@@ ation , groups coming together , groups breaking apart .
and we see the evolution of al@@ ph@@ a through time .
so when i thought about compassion , my mind immediately went to one of the carto@@ on stri@@ ps , where he &apos;s lying there and he says , &quot; i really understand , and i really appreci@@ ate how one should love one &apos;s neighb@@ or as one love &apos;s on@@ es@@ el@@ f .
you have to , of course , be aware of the needs of others , but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people .
and bal@@ an@@ cing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion , which has to be there , if you like , at our very roots .
now there is , in ju@@ da@@ ism , a gor@@ ge@@ ous story of a rich man who sat in sy@@ na@@ go@@ gue one day .
this went on for years .
and i &apos;m an acade@@ mic , so i put audi@@ ences to sleep for free .
but in ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s case , that was the beginning of the story .
that &apos;s crazy , but that &apos;s , in fact , what happens with chr@@ onic pain .
it rele@@ ased its energy all at once , and it was an explosion that was min@@ d-@@ num@@ bing .
it broke up through atmosp@@ her@@ ic pressure , it cru@@ m@@ bled , and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage .
they don &apos;t have to do global de@@ va@@ station .
if you &apos;ve heard about the may@@ an 20@@ 12 apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ se , you &apos;re going to hear about apo@@ ph@@ is , because you &apos;re ke@@ yed in to all the do@@ om@@ s@@ day networks anyway .
imagine how hard that must be , and we did it .
it has a little tiny bit of gravity , but it &apos;s enough that it can pull the astero@@ id , and you have your rock@@ ets set up , so you can -- oh , you can bar@@ ely see it here , but there &apos;s ro@@ cket pl@@ um@@ es -- and you basically , these guys are connected by their own gravity , and if you move the probe very slowly , very , very g@@ ently , you can very easily fin@@ esse that rock into a safe orbit .
what &apos;s six miles wide and can end civilization in an inst@@ ant ? an astero@@ id -- and there are lots of them out there . with humor and great visu@@ als , phi@@ l pla@@ it en@@ thr@@ alls the tedx@@ b@@ ou@@ l@@ der audience with all the ways astero@@ ids can kill , and what we must do to avoid them . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
yeah , it was the usual cock@@ tail : a little bit of thre@@ ats , a little bit of friend@@ ly ad@@ vice , a little bit of financial police , a little bit of text control , so you always have somebody who never leaves your office .
to make a long story short , the gentle@@ man comes into the office , great suit and tie .
first , under no circum@@ stances i want to hang myself .
a lot of numbers there . a lot of numbers .
i &apos;ll bet half of you have never heard of that place .
but there is a second angle to that .
we &apos;ve decided to do it this fall ; we will issue them , probably in den@@ om@@ in@@ ations of 1,000 dollars .
a free press -- pa@@ pers , maga@@ zin@@ es , radio , tv , blogs -- is the back@@ bone of any true democracy . s@@ as@@ a v@@ u@@ cin@@ ic , a journalist from bel@@ grade , talks about his new fund , which suppor@@ ts media by selling &quot; free press bon@@ ds . &quot;
i &apos;ll try to make that clear -- par@@ tially clear .
that &apos;s wrong because the theory is quant@@ um mechan@@ ical .
because they use mathematics we already have .
then you use the symme@@ try of special rela@@ tivity and you get an even simpl@@ er set down here , showing that symme@@ try exhi@@ bits better and better .
here &apos;s what new@@ ton himself said : &quot; nature is very con@@ son@@ ant and con@@ forma@@ ble to her self . &quot;
life can emer@@ ge from physics and chemistry , plus a lot of acci@@ dents .
he somehow had to es@@ cape that har@@ d-@@ sc@@ rab@@ ble farm from which he was born .
and his great friend speed went to his side and said , &quot; lincol@@ n , you must r@@ ally or you will die . &quot;
in 18@@ 6@@ 3 , when the e@@ man@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion pro@@ cla@@ ma@@ tion was sig@@ ned , he brought his old friend , jo@@ shu@@ a speed , back to the white house , and remem@@ ber@@ ed that conversation of decades before , when he was so sad .
my relationship with him began on a rather curious level .
so@@ unded very om@@ in@@ ous when he took me ne@@ ar@@ by to the la@@ ke , conven@@ i@@ ently called la@@ ke ly@@ n@@ don ba@@ ines john@@ son .
he once said that he laugh@@ ed so he did not cry , that a good story , for him , was better than a drop of wh@@ is@@ key .
in fact , i &apos;m convinced i learned the narra@@ tive art from those ni@@ ghtly s@@ essi@@ ons with my father .
he said , &quot; how often do you make these horri@@ ble wi@@ sh@@ es ? &quot;
it &apos;s about the size of a ru@@ g@@ by ball .
and that is what this cy@@ lin@@ der is , the dec@@ lar@@ ation made by the rul@@ er gui@@ ded by god who had top@@ pl@@ ed the ira@@ q@@ i des@@ po@@ t and was going to bring freedom to the people .
two great tex@@ ts , what about the politics ?
je@@ ff@@ er@@ son was a great ad@@ mir@@ er -- the ide@@ als of cy@@ rus obviously speaking to those 18@@ th century ide@@ als of how you create religious toler@@ ance in a new state .
god , we know , is usually on the side of the big bat@@ tali@@ ons .
then another ir@@ an-@@ iraq war .
it &apos;s a debate that &apos;s still continu@@ ing , and it will continue to ru@@ m@@ ble , because this object is one of the great dec@@ lar@@ ations of a human as@@ pi@@ ration .
new parents are aston@@ ished by the rapi@@ di@@ ty of this learning .
the child &apos;s daily contact with another human being is re@@ duced to a few hur@@ ried minutes of fe@@ eding and changing , and otherwise their only stimu@@ lation is the cei@@ ling , the walls or the b@@ ars of their c@@ ots .
now , there are less than 10,000 , and family support services are provi@@ ded across the country .
and then i thought , well maybe i could do something .
how do you create a day vot@@ ed by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever ce@@ as@@ e@@ fire non@@ violence day , the 21@@ st of september ?
and that was kind of like the laun@@ ch of this thing .
and we were listening to everybody .
and it was 8 : 00 am when i stood there .
i decided that i &apos;d continue fil@@ ming and make another movie .
one is you &apos;ve got to have a great idea .
and so then we wra@@ pped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .
and it &apos;s in the six offi@@ cial languages of the united nations .
i said , &quot; what would you do ?
this means that two brains of the same size , like these two , with a respe@@ c@@ table 400 gra@@ ms , should have similar numbers of neurons .
and this is where the story started to bo@@ ther me .
so , a ro@@ dent brain with 8@@ 6 billion neurons would wei@@ gh 3@@ 6 kil@@ os .
so we did the math .
so what is the human advantage ?
wh@@ il@@ st i was at phili@@ ps , we discus@@ sed this idea of a maybe technology , something that wasn &apos;t either swi@@ t@@ ched on or off , but in between .
fellow lu@@ cy m@@ cra@@ e is a body architect -- she imag@@ ines ways to mer@@ ge biology and technology in our own bodies . in this visu@@ ally stun@@ ning talk , she shows her work , from clo@@ th@@ es that re@@ create the body &apos;s insi@@ des for a music video with po@@ p-@@ star rob@@ yn , to a p@@ ill that , when s@@ wal@@ lo@@ wed , lets you swe@@ at per@@ fu@@ me .
anyway , you know every time i make this speech -- it &apos;s not the first time -- but it &apos;s an emotion .
i wonder@@ ed , what work ?
among them there was my ri@@ ght-@@ hand man , na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in .
and na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in was sta@@ ying there , doing everything and repor@@ ting on the patients .
everybody was grab@@ bing something .
he said , &quot; you have taught me to walk .
i could not believe .
we decided to emplo@@ y as many dis@@ ab@@ led as possible to train them in any possible job .
i have learned a lot from people like na@@ j@@ mu@@ dd@@ in , ma@@ hm@@ oud , ra@@ fi .
that was my story . thank you very much .
and so three months later , just before she re@@ turned to the united states , nur@@ ses in ac@@ cr@@ a go on stri@@ ke .
and so i started to argue with these men .
i had an in@@ kl@@ ing , but i didn &apos;t fully realize it until i went out into the work@@ place and i went to work at microsoft corpo@@ ration .
r@@ wand@@ a was in the thro@@ es of this geno@@ ci@@ d@@ al war .
we &apos;re trying to train leaders of ex@@ cep@@ tional integri@@ ty , who have the ability to con@@ front the complex problems , ask the right questions , and come up with work@@ able solutions .
that for many of them , it has been a life@@ -@@ alter@@ ing experience .
thank you , and god bl@@ ess .
these fre@@ ck@@ les are called s@@ uns@@ po@@ ts , and they are just one of the mani@@ fe@@ sta@@ tions of the sun &apos;s magnetic field .
as a matter of fact , this is something that about half of you , more than half of you will not be familiar with .
thir@@ t@@ y-@@ two tab@@ lets of cal@@ ms for@@ te .
i &apos;m here with all my old friends , my de@@ ce@@ ased friends , and my family and all the pu@@ pp@@ y dogs and the kit@@ tens that i used to have when i was a little girl .
you stop brea@@ thing , and then you &apos;re dead .
we all know who he is on television .
and we haven &apos;t heard from her since . strange .
i don &apos;t really need it because i &apos;ve been doing this st@@ unt for audi@@ ences all over the world for the last eight or 10 years , taking f@@ at@@ al do@@ ses of home@@ op@@ ath@@ ic sle@@ eping p@@ ills .
these people don &apos;t need the million dollars perhaps , but wouldn &apos;t you think they &apos;d like to take it just to make me look sil@@ ly ?
these are dow@@ s@@ ers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well , but they &apos;re ama@@ te@@ urs ; they don &apos;t know how to ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate their own so@@ -@@ called power@@ s .
in this hospital , there is one person quali@@ fied to deliver an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia , and she &apos;s quali@@ fied because she has 12 , maybe 18 months of training in an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
and now this r@@ out@@ ine surgery that many of you have probably experienced , and others are probably the product of , has now become a trage@@ dy .
now if you don &apos;t have power , or , god for@@ bi@@ d , the power cu@@ ts out in the middle of surgery , this machine transi@@ tions auto@@ matically , without even having to touch it , to drawing in room air from this in@@ let .
is it working ?
and i fo@@ unded my country &apos;s first graphic design and new media college .
it &apos;s a sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ary . it &apos;s not exactly an al@@ phab@@ et .
but i still think that this -- -- may be this year &apos;s version of this .
now global warming was un@@ for@@ es@@ e@@ en .
and they do this here . it &apos;s the same deal .
how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states .
gold@@ fish swa@@ m .
it was during this period that the cycle of di@@ et@@ ary and planet@@ ary destruction began , the thing we &apos;re only reali@@ zing just now .
sa@@ dly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a com@@ a , if not actually killed -- the beginning of the he@@ y@@ day of valu@@ e-@@ added food , which con@@ ta@@ ined as many so@@ y and cor@@ n products as could be cra@@ mm@@ ed into it .
as i said , 18 percent of green@@ house g@@ ases are at@@ tribu@@ ted to li@@ ve@@ stock production .
we have to take matters into our own hands , not only by ad@@ vo@@ c@@ ating for a better diet for everyone -- and that &apos;s the hard part -- but by impro@@ ving our own .
yet , there i was -- ch@@ k , ch@@ k , ch@@ k -- tu@@ cking into a big old ste@@ ak .
gra@@ ham h@@ ill : why i &apos;m a wee@@ k@@ day vege@@ t@@ arian
why the gre@@ e@@ ks ?
the interesting thing , the original thing , would be to thre@@ aten somebody with im@@ mortality .
now , the human cost of that is obvious , once you start to think about it -- the suffering , the loss -- it &apos;s also , econom@@ ically , enor@@ m@@ ously wa@@ ste@@ ful .
i said as@@ sig@@ ning a less than 20 percent prob@@ ability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have .
or how bad it can be at its worst .
but there &apos;s a kind of que@@ as@@ iness that these are un@@ natural in some way .
if you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning -- music , humor , ero@@ tic@@ ism , spiritu@@ ality , a@@ es@@ the@@ tics , nur@@ turing and car@@ ing , go@@ ssi@@ p , ch@@ at@@ ting with people -- all of these , very likely , are en@@ ab@@ led by a special circu@@ it@@ ry that we humans have , but that you could have another intelligent life form that l@@ ac@@ ks these .
a possible mode of being here would be a way of life -- a way of being , experi@@ en@@ cing , thinking , seeing , inter@@ acting with the world .
and so for me , it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context , as though you were an astron@@ aut , and see these two things as an object , because they are so inti@@ ma@@ tely bo@@ und , and one is meaning@@ less without the other .
i thre@@ w it into an orbit , and it only had one color , and when it got to the center , the paint kept running out , so i had to run in there , didn &apos;t have any control over the spi@@ got re@@ mot@@ ely .
it could be to@@ ma@@ to sau@@ ce , or anything could be dis@@ pen@@ sed -- sand , po@@ w@@ ders or anything like that .
when you look into it , it &apos;s sort of like looking at cloud patterns , but sometimes they &apos;re very mod@@ el@@ ed and highly ren@@ dered .
the universe is in our mind , and our minds are in the universe .
and i hold this pen@@ ny in the pal@@ m of my hand , and it &apos;s sti@@ cky and ru@@ sty , but it feels like i &apos;m holding a fortun@@ e .
we forget about all of our new midd@@ le-@@ class fru@@ stra@@ tions and dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments , and we feel like milli@@ on@@ air@@ es .
but two of the main things : one of it , i was lon@@ ging for more work that was appe@@ aling to a bro@@ ad public , that was acc@@ essi@@ ble .
so i should start to talk about these guys .
and what she did was she went out on a cold , dry night and brea@@ th@@ ed back and forth on the la@@ wn to leave -- to leave her life &apos;s mark , the mark of her life .
and he makes a work that answers what they think great art is .
so this is in eastern ten@@ nes@@ see , and what they decided was that we need a positive tradition that goes with death .
but it &apos;s actually a painting .
next is an austr@@ ali@@ an artist , jan@@ e@@ en j@@ ack@@ son , and this is from a project of her@@ s called &quot; what an ar@@ t@@ work does when we &apos;re not watching . &quot;
thank you . thank you .
and where it has led in origami is to things like this .
and you &apos;d think , &quot; can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity ? &quot;
now the first step , pretty easy .
so now we &apos;re ready to scale up .
she &apos;s eating him .
he studied a fol@@ ding pattern , and realized this could fold down into an extremely comp@@ act pac@@ ka@@ ge that had a very simple opening and clo@@ sing structure .
and we developed a pattern together that sc@@ ales to arb@@ it@@ r@@ arily large size , but that allows any flat ring or dis@@ c to fold down into a very ne@@ at , comp@@ act cy@@ lin@@ der .
the thing is , that this often happens in math and science .
this baby is fully electric .
if you think about this , if you just open your eyes to this possibility and start to connect the dots , you can see the evidence everywhere .
and look at that last head@@ line -- young women ear@@ ning more than young men .
it looks like women got some power boo@@ st on a video game , or like they s@@ nu@@ ck in some secret ser@@ um into their bir@@ th-@@ control p@@ ills that lets them sho@@ ot up high .
and here the story is fairly simple .
certainly , when i was in college , i had certain expec@@ tations about my life -- that my husband and i would both work , and that we would equ@@ ally raise the children .
in china , a lot of the opening up of private entreprene@@ ur@@ ship is happening because women are starting businesses , small businesses , faster than men .
even hel@@ en mir@@ ren can hold a gun these days .
and i realized how few of the grow@@ n-@@ u@@ ps that i knew were able to with@@ stand the trage@@ dies that the war vis@@ ited on them -- how few of them could even res@@ em@@ ble a normal , cont@@ ented , satis@@ fied , happy life once their job , their home , their security was destro@@ yed by the war .
but this little ex@@ cer@@ pt is a very good sum@@ mary of what he was saying during the interview .
his body disappe@@ ars , his identity disappe@@ ars from his consciousness , because he doesn &apos;t have enough attention , like none of us do , to really do well something that requires a lot of concent@@ ration , and at the same time to feel that he exists .
this is an interesting little quote from mas@@ ar@@ u i@@ bu@@ ka , who was at that time starting out son@@ y without any money , without a product -- they didn &apos;t have a product , they didn &apos;t have anything , but they had an idea .
so those two are ideal and comple@@ ment@@ ary areas from which flow is easy to go into .
and if &quot; where do you come from ? &quot;
my home would have to be whatever i car@@ ried around inside me .
and the little girl who ar@@ is@@ es out of their union will of course be not kore@@ an or ger@@ man or french or th@@ ai or scot@@ ch or can@@ adi@@ an or even american , but a wonderful and constantly evol@@ ving mix of all those places .
the whole place was absolutely sil@@ ent , but the sil@@ ence wasn &apos;t an ab@@ sen@@ ce of noise .
and it &apos;s only by ste@@ pping out of your life and the world that you can see what you most deeply care about and find a home .
so the next step for us in this process is now to find a way to let all of you build things like this , and so the way that we &apos;re approach@@ ing that is by teaching work@@ sh@@ ops to people where we explain how they can use these kinds of tools , and then also working to get the tools and the materials and techniques out into the real world in a variety of ways .
the world population has dou@@ bled since i went to school .
and these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also for@@ ge for@@ wards econom@@ ically .
but look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion western world here -- high chil@@ d-@@ survival , small families -- and all the rest , the rain@@ bo@@ w of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
and look at the position of the old west .
i &apos;m from e@@ din@@ bur@@ gh . worse news , that &apos;s even e@@ din@@ bur@@ gh .
now these three guys up here , fur@@ ch@@ gott , ig@@ nar@@ r@@ o and mu@@ rad , won the no@@ bel prize for medicine back in 199@@ 8 .
and the reason for this , it turned out , after two or three years &apos; work , was that in the skin we have huge stor@@ es not of ni@@ tri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de , because ni@@ tri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de is a gas , and it &apos;s rele@@ ased -- -- and in a few seconds it &apos;s away , but it can be turned into these forms of ni@@ tri@@ c o@@ xi@@ de -- ni@@ tra@@ te , no@@ 3 ; ni@@ tri@@ te , no@@ 2 ; ni@@ tro@@ so@@ th@@ i@@ ols .
if your leg is ch@@ opp@@ ed off and you lose blood , your body will cl@@ amp down , increase the heart rate , do everything it can to keep your blood pressure up .
we &apos;re still working at this story , we &apos;re still developing it , we &apos;re still exp@@ anding it .
that really has to do with our aging population .
why can &apos;t we ? why can &apos;t humans re@@ generate ?
so , we do re@@ generate , but for limited di@@ stances .
you place the vas@@ cular blood ves@@ sel lin@@ ing cells on the inside .
the material is actually being co@@ ated with the cells .
and instead of using ink , we use -- you just saw an in@@ k@@ je@@ t car@@ tri@@ dge -- we just use cells .
so , we st@@ ack these wa@@ f@@ ers together , using the kid@@ ney cells .
some of the work you saw today was per@@ formed by over 700 researchers at our institute across a 20@@ -@@ year time sp@@ an .
and now i can just go and go out with my friends , go do whatever i want .
every problem that &apos;s out there , somebody has the idea for .
i have 18 out of the 19 sig@@ ns of attention de@@ fic@@ it dis@@ order diagno@@ sed .
but kids , you can see these sig@@ ns in them .
this one person off@@ ered me three cents and i got him up to three and a half .
you &apos;ve got this demand over here that has money .
and i thought that was kind of cool .
so i would sit there with a la@@ wn chair and just carry up all the people who didn &apos;t have c@@ ad@@ dies .
and they could use those for practice ball@@ s .
what i do with my kids now -- i &apos;ve got two , nine and seven -- is i teach them to walk around the house and the y@@ ard , looking for stuff that needs to get done .
those are entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ ri@@ al tra@@ its that you want to be nur@@ turing .
al gore really would have had to invented the internet .
in truth , liber@@ al arts education no longer exists -- at least genu@@ ine liber@@ al arts education -- in this country .
this bre@@ w -- over@@ simpli@@ fication of ci@@ vi@@ c engagement , ide@@ alization of the exper@@ t , frag@@ ment@@ ation of knowledge , em@@ ph@@ as@@ is on technical ma@@ ster@@ y , neu@@ tr@@ ality as a condition of acade@@ mic integri@@ ty -- is tox@@ ic when it comes to pur@@ su@@ ing the vi@@ tal connections between education and the public good , between intellectual integri@@ ty and human freedom , which were at the heart -- -- of the challenge posed to and by my european colleagues .
our ways of approach@@ ing agen@@ cy and auth@@ ority turn inside out to refle@@ ct the reality that no one has the answers to the challenges facing citizens in this century , and everyone has the responsibility for trying and partici@@ p@@ ating in finding them .
the more powerful our reach , the more important the question &quot; about what ? &quot;
the problem is there is no such thing as a vi@@ able democracy made up of experts , ze@@ al@@ ots , politicians and spec@@ tat@@ ors .
indeed , it dri@@ ves me so nu@@ ts , let me just change this little fact here .
these very same people are strong belie@@ vers , in lots of con@@ tex@@ ts , in the limit@@ s on the markets .
they decided they wanted to do the same .
ll : right . b@@ ing@@ o . point .
indeed , anything you add to the ma@@ sh@@ up , music you might add , lu@@ c@@ as has a worldwide per@@ pe@@ tual right to explo@@ it that for free .
and then on twitter , somebody said to me , &quot; your talk on youtube was d@@ m@@ ca &apos;d . was that your purpose ? &quot;
open@@ ness is a commit@@ ment to a certain set of values .
and they &apos;re just so un@@ comfortable .
and then many more steps later , baby steps , they &apos;d be in the room , they &apos;d have a lea@@ ther glo@@ ve like a wel@@ der &apos;s glo@@ ve on , and they &apos;d eventually touch the sna@@ ke .
he was in the hospital looking at one of his m@@ ri machines in use when he saw a young family .
and so i &apos;ve heard dou@@ g tell the story many times , of his personal transformation and the break@@ through design that happened from it , but i &apos;ve never really seen him tell the story of the little girl without a te@@ ar in his eye .
everybody has a chan@@ ge-@@ the-@@ world thing .
we wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building , and to do this , we sam@@ pl@@ ed d@@ ust .
and when i see the power that dis@@ per@@ sal has on these bio@@ geographic patterns , it makes me think that it &apos;s possible to t@@ ack@@ le really challen@@ ging problems , like hospit@@ al-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infe@@ ctions .
a conscious approach to design , i &apos;m calling it bio@@ in@@ formed design , and i think it &apos;s possible .
and he had a platform where you lin@@ ked information to other information , and then you could call it up at will .
apple introduced a thing called hyper@@ card , and they made a bit of a f@@ uss about it .
and the very next year , in 199@@ 4 , we had the conference here in e@@ din@@ bur@@ gh , and i had no op@@ position in having tim ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ lee as the key@@ note speak@@ er .
but to really kind of person@@ i@@ fy the movement , they wanted to name it .
so , there was a clear lesson here .
but no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down .
from gand@@ o , my home village in bur@@ kin@@ a fas@@ o , to ber@@ lin in germany to become an architect is a big , big step .
the walls are totally made out of comp@@ ressed cla@@ y blocks from gand@@ o .
we wanted to use them to create open@@ ings .
the gand@@ o project was always connected to training the people , because i just wanted , one day when i fall down and die , that at least one person from gand@@ o kee@@ ps doing this work .
good morning . so magic is an exc@@ ell@@ ent way for sta@@ ying ahead of the reality cur@@ ve , to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow .
there is the color red and the color black , repres@@ enting the const@@ ant change from day to night .
magic isn &apos;t that inten@@ se . i have to war@@ n you , though , if you ever play with someone who de@@ als cards like this , don &apos;t play for money .
now , i know it &apos;s a wi@@ des@@ pre@@ ad assu@@ mption in the west that as countries moder@@ ni@@ ze , they also we@@ ster@@ ni@@ ze .
you can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from bei@@ j@@ ing , even though we think this to be the case .
one nation , one system .
the problem with this pro@@ position is that the chinese state enjo@@ ys more legi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy and more auth@@ ority am@@ on@@ gst the chinese than is true with any western state .
mor@@ e@@ over , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of stat@@ ec@@ raft .
and i &apos;ll tell you now , that east asi@@ an@@ ers , people from east asia , are far more knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able about the west than the west is about east asia .
this is the new gu@@ ang@@ z@@ ho@@ u ra@@ il@@ way station for the high-@@ speed tra@@ ins .
martin jac@@ ques : understanding the rise of china
so before going to law school in china i bought a ban@@ jo , i thre@@ w it in my little red tru@@ ck and i travel@@ ed down through app@@ al@@ ach@@ ia and i learned a bunch of old american son@@ gs , and i ended up in k@@ ent@@ u@@ cky at the international blu@@ e@@ gr@@ ass music associ@@ ation conven@@ tion .
they all come up and they &apos;re like , &quot; you know , my a@@ unt &apos;s sister &apos;s bab@@ y@@ si@@ tter &apos;s dog &apos;s chicken went to china and adop@@ ted a girl . &quot;
so i called back and i told her , &quot; look , am@@ y , tell the ted guys i just won &apos;t show up .
that &apos;s on the cham@@ p@@ s-@@ el@@ y@@ sees .
that &apos;s where i realized the power of paper and gl@@ ue .
so he went to the church of na@@ tivity and brought back an old la@@ d@@ der that was so old that it could have seen jes@@ us being born .
so the re@@ actions in the street were kind of interesting .
we need culture out there . &quot;
and they would put a number : &quot; please call this number if you know what &apos;s going on in provi@@ den@@ ci@@ a . &quot;
women are always the first ones tar@@ ge@@ ted during conflict .
so the more d@@ ust you have , the more it will reve@@ al the photo .
and that is for me one of the more important things in the work .
so for example , i pa@@ sted the photo of the min@@ ar@@ et in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land a few weeks after they vot@@ ed the law for@@ bi@@ d@@ ding min@@ are@@ ts in the country .
thank you .
and so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more conven@@ i@@ ent and less co@@ stly in many cases than ow@@ ning them .
mean@@ while , these guys are sitting back , colle@@ cting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service .
the opportunity and the challenge with mes@@ h businesses -- and those are businesses like zi@@ p@@ car or net@@ fli@@ x that are full mes@@ h businesses , or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies , car manufac@@ tur@@ ers , who are beginning to offer their own car@@ -@@ share services as well as a second f@@ lan@@ ker brand , or as really a test , i think -- is to make sharing ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble .
the areas around it lack vi@@ tality and vi@@ bran@@ cy and engagement .
and so b@@ .@@ c. in bar@@ cel@@ on@@ a and b@@ -@@ cycle and bor@@ is bi@@ kes in london -- no one has had to repe@@ at the version 1.@@ 0 scre@@ w-@@ u@@ ps and expensive learning exer@@ cis@@ es so the opportunity when we &apos;re connected is also to share fail@@ ures and success@@ es .
but there is an under@@ bel@@ ly .
increasingly , over time , this will be possible from our own skin -- able to replic@@ ate parts of the body .
the collap@@ se in bio@@ diversity , climate change , pan@@ de@@ mi@@ cs , financial cris@@ es : these will be the cur@@ ren@@ cy that we will think about .
i was sent straight away to my school princi@@ p@@ al , and my school princi@@ p@@ al , a swe@@ et nun , looked at my book with dis@@ g@@ ust , fli@@ pped through the pages , saw all the nu@@ des -- you know , i &apos;d been seeing my mother draw nu@@ des and i &apos;d copy her -- and the nun sla@@ pped me on my face and said , &quot; swe@@ et jes@@ us , this kid has already be@@ gun . &quot;
and he was very impres@@ sed . he was all te@@ aring up . ready to hu@@ g me .
thank you .
so , i wanted to be a pain@@ ter like him , except , i don &apos;t know how to paint .
the collabor@@ ative effort was fab@@ ul@@ ous .
ne@@ tra and i met when she was 18 .
this is all the press we got , and we said , it &apos;s time to celebra@@ te .
the b@@ ollywood stars who i would party with and buy my work disappe@@ ared .
i decided to have a child , and before i did that , i quickly studied what can go wrong .
i was 17 .
sw : yeah .
little sp@@ l@@ at at the end there . einstein , did that hurt ?
e : y@@ ar .
sw : good job !
sw : she &apos;s a com@@ edi@@ an . i suppose you think you &apos;re famous ? are you famous ?
you could jump off the end into the deep end .
so , moving on@@ ward .
so you end up , number three , not swi@@ mming , in the case of fre@@ est@@ yle , on your sto@@ mach , as many people think , reach@@ ing on top of the water .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s really all you need to know .
and he goes , &quot; ah@@ h , okay okay , ee@@ h@@ to , world history , e@@ h@@ h , calcul@@ us , traditional japanese . &quot; and so on .
we can talk about that if anyone in interested .
and she looked up and said , &quot; now that &apos;s better . &quot;
so i think you &apos;ll agree , they look quite good together .
and have done experiments with about 50,000 students th@@ us far -- built , i &apos;d say , about a half do@@ zen schools , my re@@ a@@ ders , at this point .
under@@ lying it was some very simple ideas that large numbers of teena@@ gers learn best by doing things , they learn best in teams and they learn best by doing things for real -- all the opposite of what main@@ stream scho@@ ol@@ ing actually does .
they &apos;re not like all of you who can sit in ro@@ ws and hear things said to you for hour after hour .
and the king@@ dom of israel , which is head@@ ed by king sau@@ l , obviously cat@@ ches wind of this , and sau@@ l brings his army down from the mountains and he con@@ fron@@ ts the phili@@ st@@ ines in the valley of el@@ ah , one of the most beautiful of the val@@ le@@ ys of the she@@ ph@@ el@@ ah .
he issues this kind of ta@@ unt towards this person coming to fight him .
more than that , the st@@ ones in the valley of el@@ ah were not normal ro@@ cks . they were bar@@ ium su@@ l@@ p@@ hate , which are ro@@ cks twice the den@@ sity of normal st@@ ones .
there &apos;s all kinds of hin@@ ts of this in the bibli@@ cal text , things that are in retro@@ spe@@ ct quite puzz@@ ling and don &apos;t square with his image as this mi@@ gh@@ ty war@@ ri@@ or .
famous . he had ac@@ ro@@ me@@ gal@@ y .
i &apos;m going to start with a little story .
and unfortunately , if you want to learn about the micro@@ organisms , just looking at them in a micro@@ scope is not suff@@ i@@ cient .
and so , people -- this is a study that i did now .
and it turns out that many ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans , old school ve@@ ter@@ in@@ ari@@ ans in particular , have been doing something called &quot; po@@ o te@@ a , &quot; not bo@@ ot@@ y , but po@@ o te@@ a , to treat co@@ lic and other a@@ il@@ ments in hor@@ ses and co@@ ws and things like that , where you make te@@ a from the po@@ o from a healthy individual animal and you feed it to a sick animal .
we are them . they are us .
a lot of people think in a very engli@@ sh@@ -@@ cent@@ ri@@ c way on the internet , but for us , we &apos;re truly global . we &apos;re in many , many languages .
first of all , how good is it ? well , it &apos;s pretty good . it isn &apos;t perfect , but it &apos;s much , much better than you would expect , given our completely cha@@ o@@ tic model .
so there &apos;s a few elements , mostly social poli@@ cies and some elements of the software .
so we do have edi@@ ts by anony@@ mous users , which is one of the most contro@@ versi@@ al and intri@@ gu@@ ing things about wikipedia .
is the information ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able ? is it a ho@@ a@@ x ? is it true ? is it what ?
i always lau@@ gh at this , because i have no idea how they &apos;re ele@@ cted , actually .
then i said , &quot; well fu@@ ck it , we &apos;ll just change the rules . &quot;
and for a lot of people in the world , if i give you an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedia that &apos;s written at a university level , it doesn &apos;t do you any good without a whole ho@@ st of liter@@ acy materials to build you up to the point where you can actually use it .
anthropo@@ logi@@ sts have found evidence of roman@@ tic love in 1@@ 70 societies .
e@@ mi@@ ly di@@ ck@@ in@@ son once wrote , &quot; par@@ ting is all we need to know of hell . &quot;
so anyway , we found activity in three brain regi@@ ons .
roman@@ tic love en@@ ables you to focus your ma@@ ting energy on just one at a time , conser@@ ve your ma@@ ting energy , and start the ma@@ ting process with this single individual .
people have often asked me whether what i know about love has spo@@ iled it for me .
and on this dat@@ ing site that i have created , called chemi@@ str@@ y@@ .com , i ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals , and i &apos;m watching who cho@@ o@@ ses who to love .
hel@@ en fis@@ her : the brain in love
i also resear@@ ched exten@@ si@@ vely on bo@@ ws around the world .
my ideal world is a place where no one is left behind , where everyone is needed exactly where they are , like the fi@@ bers and the ten@@ d@@ ons in a bo@@ w , a place where the strong is flexi@@ ble and the vulnerable is resili@@ ent .
we try to follow dolph@@ in e@@ ti@@ qu@@ ette while we &apos;re in the water , since we &apos;re actually obser@@ ving them physi@@ cally in the water .
but they can also ti@@ ghtly pack these cli@@ cks together into bu@@ z@@ zes and use them so@@ cially .
two are human words , and one is a dolph@@ in vo@@ c@@ ali@@ zing .
and these are arti@@ fi@@ cially created whi@@ st@@ les .
and we try to not touch the animals too much , we really don &apos;t want to over@@ -@@ habit@@ u@@ ate them .
for example , right now we can put their own sig@@ nature whi@@ st@@ les in the computer and requ@@ est to interact with a specific dolph@@ in .
one thing is , it &apos;s un@@ pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ce@@ able .
he &apos;s out over the chan@@ nel .
you take a position like that .
what kind of training do you do , you personally , for that ?
that &apos;s the real important thing about safety .
y@@ r : yeah . i have no che@@ ck@@ list for that .
and i came back after@@ ward on the s@@ led of the heli@@ cop@@ ter back .
stra@@ pped to a je@@ t-@@ powered wing , y@@ ves ro@@ ss@@ y is the je@@ t@@ man -- flying free , his body as the ru@@ d@@ der , above the s@@ wis@@ s al@@ ps and the grand c@@ any@@ on . after a powerful short film shows how it works , ro@@ ss@@ y takes the ted@@ global stage to share the experience and thri@@ ll of flying .
but that ability to make progress rema@@ ined almost un@@ used , until the event that revolution@@ i@@ zed the human condition and changed the universe .
look at the world . you don &apos;t see equ@@ ations car@@ ved on to the moun@@ tain@@ sides .
we see ro@@ cks .
and that impli@@ es te@@ st@@ ability , the scientific method , the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , and everything .
for instance , when de@@ meter is up@@ set , she ban@@ ish@@ es heat from her vi@@ cin@@ ity , into the other he@@ mis@@ ph@@ ere , where it makes summer .
they also have an esti@@ mate of around a billion .
now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
jo@@ sh sil@@ ver deli@@ vers his brilli@@ antly simple solution for cor@@ rec@@ ting vision at the lo@@ west cost possible -- ad@@ ju@@ stable , li@@ qui@@ d-@@ filled len@@ ses . at ted@@ global 2009 , he demo@@ s his aff@@ ord@@ able e@@ ye@@ glas@@ ses and reve@@ als his global plan to distribu@@ te them to a billion people in need by 20@@ 20 .
in 194@@ 7 , the e@@ din@@ bur@@ gh festi@@ val was born and a@@ vi@@ g@@ n@@ on was born and hundreds of others would follow in their wake .
for a few days , they trans@@ formed a massive city into a community where end@@ less possibility rei@@ g@@ ned .
and that last point has made visual effects a const@@ ant qu@@ est for perfe@@ ction .
the s@@ now and the ice were my sand@@ box , and the in@@ u@@ it were my teachers .
my clock is ti@@ cking . okay , let &apos;s stop .
we &apos;re seeing them in the beau@@ fort sea , flo@@ ating in the open ocean where the ice has mel@@ ted out .
losing that ice is like losing the soil in a garden .
it could have survi@@ ved 150 years of wh@@ aling .
they &apos;re not these little h@@ arb@@ or se@@ als .
he sc@@ ol@@ ded me out , and said , &quot; this is why we &apos;re here .
this didn &apos;t work .
she ch@@ ased that big se@@ al away , went and got its pengu@@ in and brought it to me .
make sure you still have them on you .
he &apos;s got all sorts of cool information in front of him , high-@@ tech equipment , he &apos;s got c@@ ameras , he &apos;s got a little phone that he can pick up , listen to the e@@ ars , all these senses , all these per@@ cep@@ tions .
oh , you &apos;re married . you follow direc@@ tions well .
i was looking for his wal@@ let and he gave me his phone number .
yet you had something inside your front po@@ cket .
i have no idea how that works . we &apos;ll just send that over there .
ha@@ iled as the greatest pi@@ ck@@ po@@ cket in the world , apo@@ ll@@ o rob@@ b@@ ins studies the qu@@ ir@@ ks of human behavior as he ste@@ als your watch . in a hil@@ ari@@ ous demon@@ stration , rob@@ b@@ ins sam@@ ples the bu@@ ff@@ et of the ted@@ global 20@@ 13 audience , showing how the fla@@ ws in our perception make it possible to swi@@ pe a wal@@ let and leave it on its ow@@ ner &apos;s shoul@@ der while they re@@ main clu@@ eless .
and that &apos;s why we set up the ih@@ u@@ b in nai@@ rob@@ i , an actual physical space where we could collabor@@ ate , and it is now part of an inte@@ gra@@ l tech ecosystem in kenya .
thir@@ ty ken@@ y@@ an sh@@ ill@@ ings . that &apos;s six times the cost to connect within africa .
it &apos;s built in a mod@@ ular way so that you can also atta@@ ch a satelli@@ te mo@@ du@@ le so that you could have internet connec@@ tivity even in very remote areas .
in the past , before air condi@@ tion@@ ing , we had th@@ ick walls .
it &apos;s still with that glass box because we still want that visual access , but now it &apos;s s@@ hea@@ th@@ ed with this ther@@ mo@@ -@@ bi@@ metal layer , it &apos;s a screen that goes around it , and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface .
and in this case , the ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e cor@@ respon@@ ds to reality .
because if our goal is to understand the world , to se@@ ek a deeper understanding of the world , our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder .
to find out , my collea@@ gue , cra@@ ig jo@@ se@@ ph , and i read through the liter@@ ature on anthropo@@ log@@ y , on culture vari@@ ation in mor@@ ality and also on evolutionary psych@@ ology , looking for mat@@ ches .
the fif@@ th foundation is pu@@ ri@@ ty / san@@ c@@ ti@@ ty .
we can say that liber@@ als have a kind of a two-@@ chan@@ nel , or two-@@ foundation mor@@ ality .
all is or@@ dered , all is beautiful , all the people and animals are doing what they &apos;re supposed to be doing , where they &apos;re supposed to be .
it really helps to have some sort of pun@@ ish@@ ment .
traditional auth@@ ority , traditional mor@@ ality can be quite repres@@ sive , and re@@ stri@@ ctive to those at the bottom , to women , to people that don &apos;t fit in .
these two stan@@ z@@ as con@@ tain , i think , the deep@@ est insi@@ ghts that have ever been atta@@ ined into moral psych@@ ology .
people here are passion@@ ately enga@@ ged in trying to make the world a better place .
so if they had non-@@ le@@ th@@ al weapons then they would say , &quot; well we can use them in that sort of situation .
the police -- and knowing because i &apos;ve actually helped to train police -- police , in particular western j@@ ur@@ is@@ dic@@ tions at least , are trained to de-@@ es@@ cal@@ ate force , to try and avoid using force wher@@ ever possible , and to use le@@ th@@ al force only as an absolute last res@@ ort .
there was a spi@@ ke , of course , a few years before , but that wasn &apos;t actually que@@ ens@@ land .
and in fact , one particular instance where i think that actually happens where you can look at it was the du@@ bro@@ v@@ ka the@@ at@@ re sie@@ ge in mo@@ s@@ co@@ w in 200@@ 2 , which probably a lot of you , unlike most of my students at ad@@ f@@ a , are actually old enough to remember .
but they don &apos;t ever get used like that .
i kid you not . that &apos;s exactly what it said .
we create things .
so imagine a kid : &quot; am i going to get we@@ t ? am i going to get we@@ t ?
that &apos;s what fascin@@ ates them . that &apos;s why they do what they do .
i met andre@@ w at one of our community meetings putting together maker fa@@ ire .
it &apos;s a micro@@ -@@ controll@@ er .
we just had an issue on space explor@@ ation , di@@ y space explor@@ ation .
not only can he sho@@ ot , drive , drink -- you know , he drin@@ ks wine , there actually is a little wine in there -- and of course , always we@@ ars a tu@@ x@@ e@@ do .
not a metaph@@ or@@ ical one , the way we use it today , but a liter@@ al magic sp@@ ell associated with wit@@ ches and g@@ yp@@ si@@ es and to some ex@@ tent , cel@@ tic magic .
it puts you into this special , special world .
as i said earlier , glamour does not have to be about people , but it has to have this tran@@ scen@@ dent quality .
and spre@@ zz@@ atur@@ a is the art that con@@ ce@@ als art .
trans@@ lu@@ c@@ ence is glam@@ or@@ ous -- that &apos;s why all these people wear pe@@ ar@@ ls .
that symbo@@ li@@ zes this sense of being safe and at home .
i &apos;m not against glamour .
me was always trying to become something , somebody .
i didn &apos;t he@@ ed it ; no , i organized it and i direc@@ ted it .
but the more i talked about it , the more obje@@ c@@ ti@@ fied and frag@@ mented my body became .
now i am swi@@ mming in it .
and the other women arrived and they sat in a circle , and micha@@ ela ba@@ th@@ ed my head with the sac@@ red water .
it was having a vision of the future and something to fight for , because i know this struggle isn &apos;t my own .
and put another way , the cru@@ x of the problem is the machine that we use for thinking about other minds , our brain , is made up of pieces , brain cells , that we share with all other animals , with mon@@ keys and mi@@ ce and even sea s@@ lu@@ gs .
so i &apos;m going to show you a five-@@ year-old who is getting a standard kind of puzz@@ le that we call the fal@@ se belief task .
i think he is going to take that one .
but now i &apos;m going to show you the five-@@ year-old .
and her friend drin@@ ks the coffee , and is fine .
first , i &apos;m going to show you that this is a magnetic pul@@ se .
please tell me that you &apos;re not taking phone calls from the p@@ ent@@ ag@@ on , say .
but why does anyone have to feel anything ?
so i was in new york recently , and i walked past a gy@@ m that had an adverti@@ se@@ ment in the window for a new course , a new ev@@ ening course .
i wanted to investig@@ ate this whole ro@@ ad@@ run@@ ner culture , and what it was doing to me and to everyone else .
now if you &apos;ll per@@ mit me a small act of hypo@@ cris@@ y , i &apos;ll just give you a very quick over@@ view of what &apos;s going on inside the slow movement . if you think of food , many of you will have heard of the slow food movement .
and of course , in it@@ al@@ y where -- i mean , itali@@ ans always seem to know where to find their pleasure -- they &apos;ve launched an offi@@ cial slow sex movement .
and if that &apos;s not sh@@ aming enough , i got that ti@@ cket in it@@ al@@ y .
that &apos;s really the main question before us today . is it possible to slow down ? and i &apos;m happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a res@@ o@@ unding yes .
is that a good lu@@ ck on the book tour card ? &quot;
it was complex , but there was something cap@@ ri@@ cious about its complexity .
and then you des@@ c@@ end to light and to the north and to life .
and half a million people gather@@ ed for the celebra@@ tions ; you can see them on the site itself as the foun@@ da@@ tions are beginning .
and that was a lot of heat to deal with .
through nature , the nature of the universe and the nature of man , we shall se@@ ek truth . if we se@@ ek truth , we shall find beauty . &quot;
so for example , if i played a color , like we were playing on a pal@@ ette , that so@@ unded like this ...
the only mistake is if i &apos;m not aware , if each individual musi@@ cian is not aware and accep@@ ting enough of his fellow band member to in@@ corpo@@ rate the idea and we don &apos;t allow for creativity .
it &apos;s much more organic . it &apos;s much more nu@@ an@@ ced .
do you see me on the other side of this f@@ ence ?
you know , we f@@ ought hard to get at least a small paki@@ stan@@ i cont@@ ing@@ ent to come .
i need to explain a little bit about mon@@ so@@ ons .
they control mo@@ s@@ qui@@ to lar@@ va@@ e , among other things .
didn &apos;t notice any dra@@ gon@@ flies ; maybe they were there , maybe they weren &apos;t .
but dra@@ gon@@ flies -- a bit tri@@ cky .
it &apos;s going towards india , not from india .
i got on my bi@@ cycle , and i cy@@ cl@@ ed around the island of mal@@ é .
well , to cut a long story short , they &apos;re actually flying right across the ocean .
they &apos;re looking for somewhere to bre@@ ed . if it ra@@ ins here they &apos;ll bre@@ ed .
16@@ ,000 kilometers , four generations , mind you , for a two in@@ ch long inse@@ ct . it &apos;s quite incredible .
no , they turn across here .
and the other thing , the other important factor for all these birds , all medium si@@ zed fel@@ lo@@ ws , and this inclu@@ des the next slide as well , which is a be@@ e-@@ e@@ ater .
so it was evol@@ ving up@@ wards .
just let the le@@ dge do that , and it &apos;s easy , and the next thing you know , there &apos;s 20 more tricks based out of the vari@@ ations .
this is a place not that far from here .
the greater the contribu@@ tion , the more we express and form our individu@@ ality , which is so important to a lot of us who feel like re@@ je@@ cts to begin with .
what is it that will pun@@ ch you and make you do something and bring it to another level , and when you &apos;ve had it all , sometimes , guys , they die on the v@@ ine with all of that talent , and one of the things we &apos;ve had , all of us , is f@@ ame , i think the best kind of f@@ ame , because you can take it off .
ro@@ d@@ ney mul@@ len : pop an oll@@ ie and inno@@ v@@ ate !
and he becomes obs@@ essed with the question of how to drop bom@@ bs from an airplane .
in fact , he would always get up@@ set when people refer@@ red to the bom@@ b@@ sight as his invention , because in his eyes , only god could inv@@ ent things .
so they started flying them at high al@@ ti@@ tu@@ des at incredibly high spee@@ ds .
they &apos;ve invented some kind of this thing , or this thing , or this thing that will make our world forever better .
and over the course of the last six years in nor@@ th@@ west pakistan , the ci@@ a has flo@@ wn hundreds of dr@@ one mis@@ si@@ les , and it &apos;s used those dr@@ ones to kill 2,000 sus@@ pe@@ cted paki@@ stan@@ i and taliban mili@@ tan@@ ts .
mal@@ col@@ m gla@@ d@@ well : the strange tale of the norden bom@@ b@@ sight
well , not quite . because darwin was talking about our dist@@ ant ance@@ stry , our common ance@@ stry with ap@@ es .
possibilities about our ance@@ stry , but not the prob@@ abilities that we &apos;re really looking for .
now , a quick pri@@ mer on dna .
everybody in this room , everybody in the world , falls into a lin@@ e@@ age somewhere on these trees .
well , we were going into the worst part of the last ice age .
we are in a period of long cultural st@@ as@@ is from a million years ago until around 6@@ 0,000 to 7@@ 0,000 years ago .
and as we were fin@@ ishing up that film -- it was co-@@ produced with national geographic -- i started talking to the folks at n@@ g about this work .
the majority going to something we call the leg@@ acy fund .
and yet , look around us .
and then suddenly , bang ! a universe appe@@ ars , an entire universe .
so where you get slightly den@@ ser areas , gravity starts comp@@ acting clou@@ ds of hydro@@ gen and heli@@ um atoms .
what are the gol@@ di@@ lo@@ cks conditions ?
so , dna con@@ tains information about how to make living organisms .
but it is so slow .
so fossil fu@@ els and collective learning together explain the st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing complexity we see around us .
now you might ask , what is behavi@@ oral fin@@ ance ?
we &apos;re not doing that well when it comes to in@@ sur@@ ance .
and then they have to decide how they &apos;re going to invest in their 5@@ 2 choices , and they never heard about what is a money market fund .
well that &apos;s at least what one wonderful study predi@@ cted .
but when you get your driving licen@@ se , you check the box if you do not want to don@@ ate your organ .
the other group gets two ap@@ ples , one is taken away .
save more tomorrow makes it easy .
let me wra@@ p with two key mes@@ sages .
i am wearing the al gore in-@@ ear monit@@ ors he wor@@ e on the lar@@ ry king show and i &apos;m hearing that trans@@ mission and not mine .
we want to get in as many son@@ gs as possible during our brief time here so this is the one to play .
well , i think we &apos;re going to stop that part of the show .
lei@@ ce@@ ster : may i join you , my lady ?
so , ultimately , everybody &apos;s looking at you , 200 people at seven in the morning who got there at quar@@ ter to seven , and you arrived at seven , and everybody &apos;s saying , &quot; hey . what &apos;s the first thing ? what &apos;s going to happen ? &quot;
and at night i would lie out , looking at the un@@ pollu@@ ted sky , as del@@ hi used to be at that time when i was a kid , and i used to st@@ are at the universe and say , &quot; how far does this universe go ? &quot;
so that &apos;s as wide as we look at stories .
what is wonderful is , at many times , the stories will con@@ tradi@@ ct with each other .
i said &quot; it &apos;s about my@@ th@@ ology , the go@@ ds . &quot;
tell me . say it . is the child his ? is it his ?
she &apos;s in the absolute well of her own sense of being mor@@ tal .
now , where does this upp@@ er city and lower city come ?
in the mind of a man and a woman , we &apos;re looking constantly at the con@@ tradi@@ ction between male and female , we &apos;re looking for harmon@@ y within each other .
i found out how many people had been put in ja@@ il , how many family members had been killed .
50 companies sig@@ ned up , 200 products came out , gener@@ ated 100 million in sal@@ es .
population times consumption has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet , and right now , it &apos;s a simple &quot; not equal . &quot;
who have you heard talking l@@ ately that &apos;s said we have to tri@@ ple production of goods and services ?
do organic po@@ tat@@ o@@ es actually have fewer tox@@ ic chemicals than conven@@ tional po@@ tat@@ o@@ es ?
we looked at the thre@@ ats to these places .
because if these companies demand sustainable products , they &apos;ll pull 40 to 50 percent of production .
so it &apos;s the demand that brings them to the table .
but they &apos;re doing some really interesting things around cho@@ col@@ ate , and it all comes from the fact that mars wants to be in business in the future .
we &apos;re all on that same journey with them .
my idea : we a@@ wa@@ ken this network .
this lo@@ com@@ o@@ tion was completely invol@@ un@@ t@@ ary .
and here , you can see one such example , where we lab@@ el the fi@@ bers coming from the brain in red .
and this is a radi@@ cally new concept that may apply to other neuro@@ logi@@ cal dis@@ orders , what i ter@@ med &quot; person@@ alized neuro@@ pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics , &quot; where by sen@@ sing and stimul@@ ating neu@@ ral inter@@ faces , i implan@@ ted throughout the nervous system , in the brain , in the spin@@ al cor@@ d , even in peri@@ pher@@ al ner@@ ves , based on pati@@ ent@@ -@@ specific im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ments .
nei@@ ther of them atten@@ ded university .
what he said , that all too often , is that we accept the distance between those two ideas .
and they opened many new do@@ ors for millions of female doctors and nur@@ ses and artists and auth@@ ors , all of whom have followed them .
it was built by the ti@@ mber of her ma@@ je@@ sty &apos;s ship resol@@ ute and given by queen vic@@ tor@@ ia .
i spent two weeks at this re@@ treat in my own little hu@@ t -- no music , no nothing , sounds of nature -- trying to find the essen@@ ce of concent@@ ration , being in the moment .
there &apos;s ar@@ men@@ ian , russi@@ an , french , english , itali@@ an .
and as you can tell , they are basically go@@ of ball@@ s .
it &apos;s just part of your neighbor@@ ly du@@ ty .
then , at moment number two , you have the fa@@ ke announ@@ c@@ ement go out .
in fact , wikipedia is an idea so pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly stupid that even j@@ im@@ bo never had it .
not because it &apos;s a job , not because it &apos;s a career , but because it &apos;s a calling .
wow . blogs are going to change your business .
and it &apos;s no longer just a &quot; i don &apos;t know . i couldn &apos;t get there . i guess i &apos;ll move on , &quot; but suddenly a collective consciousness about what is blo@@ cked and cen@@ sor@@ ed where online .
it &apos;s not a n@@ ou@@ n . it &apos;s a ver@@ b .
now , some people have cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zed us for this .
these countries have moved on from provi@@ ding exc@@ ell@@ ence for just some to provi@@ ding exc@@ ell@@ ence for all , a very important lesson .
remember , that was the year before the ipo@@ d was invented .
well , if you only focus on your bri@@ gh@@ test students , you know what happens is dis@@ par@@ i@@ ties grow , and you can see this bubble moving slightly to the other direction , but still , an impres@@ sive impro@@ vement .
but usually that is lin@@ ked to very strong social dis@@ par@@ i@@ ties .
the goal of the past was standar@@ di@@ zation and compli@@ ance .
how can we measure what makes a school system work ? andre@@ as schlei@@ cher wal@@ ks us through the p@@ is@@ a test , a global measu@@ re@@ ment that ran@@ ks countries against one another -- then uses that same data to help schools improve . watch to find out where your country stac@@ ks up , and learn the single factor that makes some systems out@@ per@@ form others .
it em@@ power@@ s auth@@ ori@@ ties , without activ@@ ating the citizens -- their hands , legs , brains , what have you .
and all those phones were in the few urban places .
but in order to exp@@ and that , you need a river , or you need a high@@ way , or you need tele@@ phone lines .
they had mo@@ de@@ ms .
after about a million -- i mean , i got re@@ je@@ cted from lots of places , because i was not only trying to go to a poor country , i was trying to go to the poor of the poor country .
&quot; services cost too much for the poor . &quot;
i loved statistics from a young age .
and it ends like this : &quot; this tele@@ graph is a fantastic instrument to diff@@ use religion , civilization , liber@@ ty and law throughout the world . &quot;
actually if we go back into the histor@@ ical record , there was a time hundreds of years ago when the income per person in india and china was even above that of europe .
in 194@@ 9 we saw the emergen@@ ce of the modern china in a way which surprised the world .
there they are today .
now here we have the whole world . you have the le@@ gend down there .
i can compare to japan . this is japan coming up .
the 2@@ 7@@ th of ju@@ ly , 20@@ 4@@ 8 is my 100@@ th birth@@ day .
so we have these stars going around in cir@@ cles like this .
can we see it more visu@@ ally ? yes , we can .
if there is a c@@ one of light coming into my eye , what do i see ?
and so , here &apos;s an image from the hu@@ b@@ ble space telescop@@ e .
now , what ste@@ phen ha@@ w@@ king mentioned , as well , is that after the big bang , space exp@@ and@@ ed at a very ra@@ pid rate .
do we have anything for dark matter ? and the answer is yes .
and i &apos;m sure you have lots of questions , which i very much look forward to add@@ res@@ sing over the next 7@@ 2 hours , while i &apos;m here . thank you .
all under the age of 16 , brothers jon@@ ny , rob@@ b@@ ie and tom@@ my mi@@ zz@@ one are from new jer@@ sey , a us state that &apos;s better known for the rock of bru@@ ce spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en than the blu@@ e@@ gr@@ ass of ear@@ l sc@@ ru@@ g@@ gs . non@@ eth@@ eless , the si@@ bl@@ ings began per@@ forming blu@@ e@@ gr@@ ass co@@ vers , as well as their own com@@ posi@@ tions , at a young age . here , they play three da@@ zz@@ ling son@@ gs in three different keys , pas@@ sing the lead back and forth from fi@@ dd@@ le to ban@@ jo to gu@@ it@@ ar .
and they are colle@@ cted en mass -- you can see the scale of it here -- and sor@@ ted out , by hand , back into the right si@@ zes , and then put back out on the street .
thank you very much .
if you &apos;re an un@@ infe@@ cted man living in bot@@ s@@ wan@@ a , where the hiv rate is 30 percent , if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner , gir@@ l@@ friend , mi@@ stress -- your chance of dying in 10 years incre@@ ases by three percentage points .
i think it &apos;s possible , if we think about that intuition , and think about that fact , that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change .
people aren &apos;t changing their behavior enough to de@@ cre@@ ase the growth in the epidemic .
it kill@@ s people in the prime of their lives .
so i am going to talk about ex@@ por@@ ts and pri@@ ces .
it &apos;s been replic@@ ated in kenya , and tanz@@ ania , and south africa and many other places .
there are more things that i think that i want to do .
and the organisms , i promise you , have all of their pri@@ ori@@ ties in order .
what i &apos;d like to do is show you a few of the things that they &apos;re learning .
and that pattern , the architecture of that pattern on its skin den@@ tic@@ les keep bacteria from being able to land and ad@@ here .
it &apos;s self-@@ assem@@ bling .
we use five poly@@ mers in the natural world to do everything that you see .
here &apos;s a wind tur@@ bine manufac@@ tur@@ er that went to a wh@@ ale .
and he &apos;s gather@@ ing all biological information on one website .
if they disappe@@ ar , so do we .
pol@@ lin@@ ation : it &apos;s vi@@ tal to life on earth , but lar@@ gely un@@ seen by the human eye . film@@ maker lou@@ ie schwar@@ tz@@ berg shows us the intri@@ c@@ ate world of pollen and pol@@ lin@@ ators with gor@@ ge@@ ous high-@@ speed images from his film &quot; wings of life , &quot; inspired by the van@@ ishing of one of nature &apos;s primary pol@@ lin@@ ators , the hon@@ e@@ y@@ be@@ e .
and since i said they &apos;re my role models , i followed two things which my father and mother gave me .
but i decided no , it &apos;s a power to prevent , because that &apos;s what i learned when i was growing up .
but 10,000 men , of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 -- 9@@ ,000 plus about 600 were men .
teachers were pris@@ on@@ ers . teachers were volunte@@ ers .
this is a feedback box called a pe@@ ti@@ tion box .
so for example , in the case of ti@@ ck@@ et@@ master , the reason you have to type these di@@ stor@@ ted characters is to prevent sc@@ al@@ pers from writing a program that can buy millions of ti@@ ckets , two at a time .
so see , here &apos;s the thing .
and now the reason we have two words no@@ wa@@ days instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
here &apos;s another really bad one .
this is something that we &apos;ve been se@@ mi@@ -@@ quie@@ tly working on for the last year and a half or so .
it makes a lot of mista@@ kes .
it &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of english .
we give you very , very simple sent@@ ences along with what each word means .
remember , this is 50 million doll@@ ar@@ s-@@ worth of value .
t@@ wel@@ ve years ago , i fo@@ unded zi@@ p@@ car .
it &apos;s a phenomen@@ al thing . it &apos;s the equivalent of 2,@@ 500 t@@ g@@ v tra@@ ins , and just think , they didn &apos;t have to lay a track or buy a car .
there are many , many examples and i &apos;ll give you one that is not my favorite example : in@@ sur@@ ance .
they d@@ ress differently , and they look different , and , really , i love these photos every time i look at them .
a decade ago , ro@@ bin ch@@ ase fo@@ unded zi@@ p@@ car in the us , now the largest car@@ -@@ sharing company in the world . now she &apos;s explor@@ ing the next level of car@@ -@@ sharing : bu@@ zz@@ car , a french star@@ tu@@ p that lets people r@@ ent their own cars to others . the details are fascinating , and the larger vision points to a new definition of ow@@ ner@@ ship and entreprene@@ ur@@ ship .
this guy is sitting here working on his computer , and yet he could be thinking about the vac@@ ation he had last month , wondering what he &apos;s going to have for dinner .
it &apos;s possible that &apos;s the case , but it might also be the case that when people are un@@ happy , then they min@@ d-@@ wan@@ der .
in 197@@ 9 , i wit@@ n@@ essed my first military cou@@ p .
and i was thinking , was ghana se@@ arch@@ ing for its identity like i was looking for my identity ?
people were being be@@ aten bru@@ t@@ ally .
so the people went back to the po@@ ll@@ s to deter@@ mine their own president , not the legal system .
it was called -- it was called &quot; the air pu@@ mp , &quot; or something like &quot; the le@@ vi@@ a@@ than and the air pu@@ mp . &quot;
right ? and immediately , he got into trouble with the local c@@ ler@@ g@@ y who said , you can &apos;t make a vac@@ u@@ um .
and there was all kind of people that would come to the ro@@ y@@ al society , they called it . you had to be d@@ ressed up pretty well .
what &apos;s happening here , in the middle of the 17@@ th century , was that what became my field -- science , experiment@@ al science -- was pul@@ ling itself away , and it was in a physical way , because we &apos;re going to do it in this room over here , but it was also what -- it was an amazing thing that happened .
i thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way .
and he had po@@ tas@@ si@@ um ni@@ tra@@ te .
and once in a while , they would b@@ low up .
ok . all scientists aren &apos;t like that .
and most responsible people that measure temper@@ atures realize you have to shi@@ el@@ d your meas@@ uring device from that .
i mean , you can talk about that stuff , and you can write these large repor@@ ts , and you can get government money to do it , but these -- they actually measu@@ red it , and it turns out that in the last 10 years -- that &apos;s why they say &quot; dec@@ ad@@ al &quot; there -- that the energy -- that the level of what they call &quot; im@@ balance &quot; has been way the hell over what was expected .
i was raised in se@@ ou@@ l , korea , and moved to new york city in 199@@ 9 to att@@ end college .
this was taken in the ri@@ vier@@ a sugar factory in red ho@@ ok , broo@@ kl@@ yn .
this is the same tun@@ nel .
it &apos;s full of history , and also full of under@@ ground bun@@ kers and ru@@ ins from the war .
and all this time , i never saw a single rat in any of these places , until recently , when i was in the london se@@ wers .
so the first question , and you might want to write this down , either on a bit of paper , physi@@ cally , or a virtual piece of paper in your head . and , for vie@@ wers at home , you can try this as well .
now , i have some rather bad news , which is that i had a piece of video that i was about to show you , which unfortunately -- the sound doesn &apos;t work in this room , so i &apos;m going to describe to you , in true &quot; mon@@ ty py@@ th@@ on &quot; fashion , what happens in the video . and in the video , a group of researchers go to mit on gradu@@ ation day .
and if you think the ti@@ lt is ti@@ l@@ ting us closer , no , it isn &apos;t .
these are examples of what i would say is bad practice in science teaching centers . these pictures are from la vil@@ le@@ tte in fr@@ ance and the wel@@ come wing of the science museum in london .
and the second question to that then is , en@@ sure you &apos;ve expla@@ ined how it is that planes can fly up@@ side down .
and evolution , although it was establi@@ shed well over 100 years ago by charles darwin and a vast number of other people , evolution still is a little bit in@@ tan@@ gi@@ ble .
you can see there &apos;s architecture growing , fil@@ ling the vo@@ id .
but before we can make life , let &apos;s think for a second what life really is characteri@@ zed by .
we somehow got to proteins and dna .
we can do it micro@@ flu@@ i@@ dic@@ ally , we can do it li@@ th@@ ogra@@ phi@@ cally , we can do it in a 3d prin@@ ter , we can do it in dro@@ ple@@ ts for colleagues .
and all i wanted to show you is we can set up molecules in mem@@ bran@@ es , in real cells , and then it sets up a kind of molecular dar@@ win@@ ism , a molecular survival of the fit@@ test .
but not only just that , we will start to think about how we can start to develop a sym@@ bio@@ tic relationship with biology .
lee cr@@ on@@ in : so many people think that life took millions of years to k@@ ick in .
and even mi@@ gh@@ ty brazil is going down with five percent per year , and tur@@ key with seven percent per year .
but these sur@@ ve@@ ys are co@@ stly , so they can only be done &#91; in &#93; thre@@ e@@ - to five-@@ year inter@@ v@@ als .
they say , &quot; 0@@ .@@ 9 percent , no progress . &quot;
so is this fair now to measure this over 19 years ?
so let me show the wi@@ der picture .
the ni@@ le del@@ ta was a mis@@ ery for children with di@@ arr@@ he@@ al disease and malaria and a lot of problems .
this is what happened . now i start the world .
we have to have a modern concept , which f@@ its to the data .
what are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many ?
and it was &#91; un@@ clear &#93; tat@@ a trust , which gave me six ru@@ pe@@ es per month , almost a dollar per month for six years .
can you believe it ?
and the seat ris@@ er , for example , ser@@ ving as a moun@@ ting for the seat as well as a struc@@ tural part of the func@@ tional ri@@ gi@@ di@@ ty .
here is an american citi@@ zen and his son having an artificial foot .
&quot; no ... not at all . &quot;
for example , we don &apos;t want 20@@ ,000 dollars ; we don &apos;t have it .
and he also said , &quot; i would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all . &quot;
and there &apos;s a 2@@ 5@@ -@@ dollar in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or giving that performance that had been created .
but it was a poor school with rich teachers , hon@@ est@@ ly .
and currently i &apos;m president of global research alli@@ ance , 6@@ 0,000 scientists in nine coun@@ ties , right from india to the u.@@ s .
i &apos;ve gotten a lot of interest and encoura@@ gement from my family , friends , teachers and even people at the apple store , and that &apos;s been a huge help to me .
but this is actually a talk about , okay -- — but this is actually a talk about fis@@ sion .
you know , in the cold war , we built up this huge ar@@ sen@@ al of nuclear weapons , and that was great , and we don &apos;t need them anymore , and what are we doing with all the waste , essentially ?
one , it doesn &apos;t operate at high pressure .
i mean , now we &apos;re talking about 100 me@@ ga@@ wat@@ ts .
but then along came the industrial revolution , and then goods became the pre@@ domin@@ ant economic off@@ ering , where we used com@@ modi@@ ties as a ra@@ w material to be able to make or manufac@@ ture goods .
and the question isn &apos;t really so much a question as an acc@@ us@@ ation .
in fact , you can look at how each of these econom@@ ies developed , that each one has their own business im@@ per@@ ative , mat@@ ched with a consumer sensi@@ bility .
as businesses , are the economic off@@ er@@ ings you are provi@@ ding -- are they true to themselves ?
now the easi@@ est way to fall down in this , and not be real real , right , the easi@@ est way not to be true to yourself is not to understand your her@@ it@@ age , and there@@ by repu@@ di@@ ate that her@@ it@@ age .
they said , you want to know who we are , you have to come experience us .
i fell in love with the way things moved , so i started to explore motion by making little fli@@ p@@ books .
this next one here , &quot; machine with wi@@ sh@@ bone , &quot; it came about from playing with this wi@@ sh@@ bone after dinner .
i &apos;m imag@@ ining myself as a machine .
so , that &apos;s a finished ge@@ ar .
thank you .
45 days em@@ br@@ yo &apos;s heart is be@@ ating twice as fast as the mother &apos;s .
the complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion or any exi@@ sting mathematics today .
because i &apos;ve noticed a very small symme@@ try in the profi@@ le of one of the planet ho@@ st stars .
and if you place a cool gas in front of a hot source , you will see certain patterns which we call absor@@ ption lines .
perhaps we even think that maybe super@@ no@@ va explo@@ sions tri@@ g@@ ger forma@@ tions of planets and stars .
it &apos;s very complicated . i don &apos;t really want you to try to understand what is here .
how to measure , if we have planets where the amount of those elements is small , so those planets are te@@ c@@ ton@@ ically dead , there cannot be life .
we have to dete@@ ct oxygen or o@@ zone to make sure that we have all necessary conditions to have life .
it will take about five years .
and she went , &quot; ha@@ ha . there &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
well , appar@@ ently this is the way my work went as well , because , when you ask people about love , they tell you about hear@@ t@@ break .
i kind of understood , this is what sh@@ ame is , this is how it works .
and the last was they had connection , and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity , they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were , which you have to absolutely do that for connection .
so i found a therap@@ ist .
for me , it was a ye@@ ar@@ long street fight .
i don &apos;t want to feel these .
we perfect .
just to be able to stop and , instead of cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ zing what might happen , to say , &quot; i &apos;m just so gr@@ ate@@ ful , because to feel this vulnerable means i &apos;m alive . &quot;
but what &apos;s interesting is the incredible deta@@ iled information that you can get from just one sen@@ sor like this .
some people will say it &apos;s for public health research .
&quot; given my status , what is the best out@@ come i can hope to achieve , and how do i get there ? &quot;
we did this for als . we can do this for depression , par@@ kin@@ son &apos;s disease , hiv .
or , i want to look at an@@ x@@ iety , because people are pra@@ ying for an@@ x@@ iety .
i can look at my con@@ sti@@ pa@@ tion , how to manage it .
this is a report about a drug called li@@ th@@ ium .
i can &apos;t say whether li@@ th@@ ium works in all als patients , but i can say whether it works in hum@@ ber@@ to .
and the ones in the middle are all of our patients from the start of li@@ th@@ ium at time zero , going forward , and then going back@@ ward .
we have to go talk to him . because i &apos;d like to know what happened .
the b@@ 15 ic@@ e@@ berg broke off the ross ice shel@@ f .
but this chi@@ cken@@ wire carbon , called a carbon nan@@ ot@@ u@@ be , is a hundred thousand times smaller than the wid@@ th of one of your ha@@ irs .
suddenly you &apos;ve conver@@ ted energy into an electr@@ on on a plastic surface that you can stick on your window .
and i &apos;m gla@@ d to see their disco@@ ver@@ ies coming out of the lab and into the world .
the first quote is from je@@ an-@@ c@@ lau@@ de tri@@ ch@@ et when he was gover@@ nor of the european central bank .
so what do we know about complex systems ?
in this little example , you can see a few financial institutions with some of the many links high@@ ligh@@ ted .
well , ow@@ ner@@ ship gives vot@@ ing rights to sh@@ are@@ hol@@ ders .
well , the high degree of control you saw is very extreme by any standard .
and this is an analog@@ y for today &apos;s construction and manufacturing world with bru@@ te@@ -@@ force assem@@ bly techniques .
and those inter@@ actions allow for er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion , and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state .
so today for the first time , we &apos;re un@@ v@@ ei@@ ling a new project , which is a collaboration with strat@@ as@@ ys , and it &apos;s called 4@@ d prin@@ ting .
let &apos;s go back to infrastructure .
and i saw my sister &apos;s face , this wa@@ il of pain and suffering and surprise thre@@ at@@ ening to er@@ u@@ pt from her mouth and thre@@ at@@ ening to wake my parents from the long winter &apos;s na@@ p for which they had sett@@ led .
so one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psych@@ ology cour@@ ses is how , in a stati@@ st@@ ically val@@ id way , do we elimin@@ ate the wei@@ r@@ do@@ s .
which , even at y@@ ale , is extra@@ ordin@@ arily rare .
what we found is that only 25 percent of job success@@ es are predi@@ cted by i@@ .@@ q .
and if happiness is on the opposite side of success , your brain never gets there .
sha@@ wn ach@@ or : the happy secret to better work
i can &apos;t tell you -- family business story : you &apos;d understand this -- my father was the most sin@@ c@@ ere man possible .
so i kind of swi@@ t@@ ched . i went to mit , finished .
they were saying , make it stop now .
they &apos;re pi@@ cking up a giant flo@@ pp@@ y dis@@ k made of car@@ d@@ board .
he was the first digital media produ@@ cer in to@@ k@@ yo .
you get it ? no ? o@@ .@@ k .
recently , this is for re@@ e@@ bo@@ k .
so , three years ago i discovered , the letters m-@@ i@@ -@@ t oc@@ curr@@ ing in simpli@@ city and complexity .
designer john ma@@ e@@ da talks about his path from a se@@ attle to@@ f@@ u factory to the r@@ ho@@ de island school of design , where he became president in 2008 . ma@@ e@@ da , a ti@@ rel@@ ess experim@@ enter and a wi@@ tty obser@@ ver , explor@@ es the cru@@ cial moment when design met computers .
they &apos;ve done a lot of good for girls in these situations , and we ought to be thinking about how we can make that happen for boys too in their yo@@ unger years .
&quot; now i have to write what she tells me to write . &quot;
men don &apos;t bel@@ ong here , that &apos;s pretty obvious .
it &apos;s not develop@@ ment@@ ally appropriate , and it &apos;s particularly bad for boys .
and we discovered that they talk about the kids in their school , who talk about gam@@ ing , in pretty de@@ meaning ways .
for this reason , the majority of theore@@ tical physi@@ ci@@ sts believe that the hig@@ gs bo@@ son could not be the full story .
because of quant@@ um tun@@ nel@@ ing , i could disappe@@ ar from this room and re@@ appear in the next room , prac@@ tically pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ating the wall .
our calcu@@ lation shows that quant@@ um tun@@ nel@@ ing of the hig@@ gs field is not likely to occu@@ r in the next 10 to the 100 years , and this is a very long time .
from this , we discovered that the hig@@ gs field that per@@ me@@ ates spac@@ e-@@ time may be standing on a kni@@ fe edge , ready for co@@ s@@ mic collap@@ se , and we discovered that this may be a hin@@ t that our universe is only a gra@@ in of sand in a giant beach , the multi@@ verse .
there were 2@@ 2,000 she@@ ep , and it was about 40 degrees , or 100 or so fahr@@ enheit .
so i got about 10 credit cards and lo@@ ans and got myself very close to bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy , really , and bought myself this huge prin@@ ting press , which i had no idea how to use at all .
and we wanted to try and encourage people to use energy better .
so my 15@@ -year-old nie@@ ce , she &apos;s amazing , and she &apos;s called char@@ lot@@ te , and i asked her to record something , and i worked with a friend called elli@@ ot to put some be@@ ats together .
others re@@ ac@@ ted in asking you for help , and some people hi@@ de from you .
so i like this about inter@@ active video sculp@@ ture , that you can actually interact with it , that all of you can actually touch an ar@@ t@@ work and be part of the ar@@ t@@ work y@@ ourselves , and hopefully , one day , i &apos;ll have each and every one of you tra@@ pped in one of my j@@ ars .
the fa@@ a , about a year ago , gave us an ex@@ emp@@ tion for the transition to allow us to have an addi@@ tional 1@@ 10 l@@ bs .
and you &apos;re all thinking what your neighb@@ ors would think of seeing that .
for those of you who aren &apos;t yet pil@@ ots , there &apos;s four main reasons why those of us who are don &apos;t fly as much as we &apos;d like to : the weather , pri@@ mar@@ ily , cost , long do@@ or@@ -@@ to-@@ door travel time and mo@@ bility at your dest@@ ination .
and they came up with a very good engineering solution , which was to spend six billion pounds building completely new tra@@ cks from london to the coast , and kno@@ cking about 40 minutes off a three-@@ and-@@ hal@@ f-@@ hour journey time .
and you get a far lower risk of fam@@ ine , because you actually had two cro@@ ps to fall back on , not one .
all value is percei@@ ved value .
it &apos;s perfectly possible to create these social pres@@ sur@@ es which lead to more eg@@ al@@ it@@ arian societies .
we invented the whole lot of them .
there was a young inter@@ n at og@@ il@@ vy canada called h@@ unter som@@ er@@ ville , who was working in impro@@ v in tor@@ onto , and got a part@@ -@@ time job in adverti@@ sing , and was given the job of adverti@@ sing sh@@ red@@ dies .
the first one ?
when i tried my first trick , it looked like this .
what i learned from the yo@@ -@@ yo is , if i make enough effort with huge passion , there is no impossible .
what did darwin say ?
you don &apos;t need a designer , or a plan , or for@@ es@@ ight , or anything else .
so , he took the gre@@ ek word &quot; mi@@ me@@ me , &quot; which means that which is im@@ it@@ ated .
they &apos;re sel@@ fish information , they will get cop@@ i@@ ed , if they can .
it gives us a completely new view of human orig@@ ins and what it means to be human , all conven@@ tional theor@@ ies of cultural evolution , of the orig@@ in of humans , and what makes us so different from other species .
we have a new kind of me@@ mes now .
human intelligence is only one kind of a thing .
how many mothers do we have here ?
that &apos;s how it seems to us .
i have no idea .
we in@@ spe@@ cted schools and private res@@ iden@@ cies .
it won &apos;t cost us any more to do it the right way . &quot;
the nur@@ ses in my department thought that the right approach was the ri@@ pping one , so they would grab hold and they would ri@@ p , and they would grab hold and they would ri@@ p .
here were wonderful people with good inten@@ tions and pl@@ ent@@ y of experience , and ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless they were getting things wrong predic@@ t@@ ably all the time .
now , in economic theory , che@@ ating is a very simple co@@ st-@@ benefit analysis .
ini@@ tially we said , what can we do to s@@ hr@@ ink the fu@@ dge factor ?
and then they took the something else , they walked 12 feet to the side , and ex@@ changed it for dollars .
what would happen to the other people in the group ?
would they not be able to see it this way ?
but in fact , this is the situation we &apos;re all in all the time .
and it &apos;s currently around that kind of 1@@ 10 dollar mark in value .
lo@@ y@@ al@@ ty essentially is a micro@@ -@@ economy .
so ni@@ ke is literally acting as a well-@@ being partner , a health and fit@@ ness partner and service provi@@ der .
when i go to par@@ ties , it doesn &apos;t usually take very long for people to find out that i &apos;m a scientist and i study sex .
but when i went to graduate school to study bi@@ ome@@ chan@@ ics , i really wanted to find a dis@@ ser@@ tation project that would exp@@ and our knowledge of skelet@@ al function .
but at the time when i started this project , the best explanation i could find for pen@@ al er@@ e@@ ction was that the wall surro@@ unded these spon@@ g@@ y tis@@ su@@ es , and the spon@@ g@@ y tis@@ su@@ es filled with blood and pressure ro@@ se and vo@@ il@@ a ! it became er@@ e@@ ct .
it l@@ eng@@ th@@ ens , shor@@ tens and ben@@ ds really easily in response to intern@@ al or ex@@ ternal forces .
now what that tells us is that wall tis@@ su@@ es are doing so much more than just co@@ vering the vas@@ cular tis@@ su@@ es .
my mom taught me to dance when i was five , and my dad taught me to play fi@@ dd@@ le when i was nine .
t@@ wel@@ ve years , er , 20 years later little did she think her kids would be getting married , but anyway , so , then i got a phone call about , i dun@@ no , seven years later . i was 19 , first or second year of college , and it was don@@ n@@ ell , and he said &quot; hi , you probably don &apos;t know me but my name is don@@ n@@ ell lea@@ h@@ y . &quot;
n@@ m : okay . sure .
what can i say ? i don &apos;t know what to say , nat@@ al@@ ie . we , u@@ h ...
and yet , just like sal@@ man , they were li@@ fel@@ ong , ten@@ ac@@ i@@ ous self-@@ lear@@ ners , and our home was stac@@ ked with thousands of books , recor@@ ds and ar@@ t@@ work .
and then something fascinating happened .
i &apos;m sick of it .
and all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile app@@ s .
it conne@@ cts us to our loved ones , our family , friends and colleagues , at home and over@@ se@@ as .
the mobile phone has given people around the world an important tool towards ga@@ ining their political freedom .
even if i could have aff@@ or@@ ded the phone bil@@ ls home , like most people in the con@@ go , my parents did not own a phone line .
so in this example , a distribution company has said , we &apos;ve got a rus@@ h order that we &apos;ve got to get out of the war@@ e@@ house tomorrow morning .
she may have pos@@ s@@ essi@@ ons that she would like to trade at times she doesn &apos;t need them .
like everyone else , those poli@@ cy@@ makers are taking it for gran@@ ted that modern markets are the preser@@ ve of organizations powerful enough to create them for themselves .
and it &apos;s a series of markets for low-@@ level trade that can be ful@@ filled by a person or a small company .
is it worth their while ?
i thought he would ask for a to@@ y , or c@@ and@@ y , and he asked me for sli@@ p@@ pers , because he said that his feet were cold .
and i ate the dis@@ liked ones first , because the ones you like , you want to save .
and sorry about that , but this is what turns me on .
and it &apos;s this reaction that we want to do .
so , how would we make it ?
we have to start putting electricity on the gri@@ d in this very complex technology .
but it &apos;s the largest ar@@ ab country and it &apos;s also one with a great deal of influence .
while as@@ pir@@ ing to democracy the most , they were the least likely population in the world to say that they had actually vo@@ ic@@ ed their opinion to a public offi@@ cial in the last month -- at only four percent .
but people &apos;s expec@@ tations for their future went up signific@@ antly .
because we discovered a link between men &apos;s support for women &apos;s emplo@@ y@@ ment and how many women are actually emplo@@ yed in professional fields in that country .
now the parents are really al@@ ar@@ med .
so think about it , a text hot@@ line ; it &apos;s pretty powerful .
you could say to a princi@@ p@@ al , &quot; you &apos;re having a problem every th@@ ur@@ s@@ day at three o &apos;@@ clock .
cle@@ men@@ ce@@ au said , &quot; life gets interesting when we fail , because it &apos;s a sign that we &apos;ve sur@@ passed ourselves . &quot;
and we are flying it , or trying to .
this is a hum@@ m@@ ing@@ bird dr@@ one .
and it &apos;s not just passi@@ ve structures , it &apos;s entire machines .
for 15 years , it was uns@@ ol@@ ved in the scientific community .
so can you .
and remember , be nice to ner@@ ds .
rd : yeah ?
rd : sure .
in aug@@ ust 2008 , u@@ a@@ e public offi@@ ci@@ als not@@ ed that 40 percent of the country &apos;s 1,@@ 0@@ 9@@ 8 labor cam@@ ps had viol@@ ated minim@@ um health and fire safety regu@@ lations .
when i reach the sum@@ mit of a ste@@ ep mountain in the middle of no@@ where , i feel young , inv@@ inci@@ ble , e@@ ternal .
we &apos;re going down@@ h@@ ill in some ro@@ cky ter@@ rain , and the front ti@@ re of ale@@ x gets caught in one of these cre@@ vas@@ ses here .
and i would say , &quot; rela@@ x , ale@@ x .
so right now , i feel more like these are my principles , and if you don &apos;t like them , i have others .
in one of them , one of the kids once said , &quot; when we were ri@@ ding on this ri@@ dge over@@ looking the dead sea -- and he &apos;s talking about this spot here -- &quot; i was re@@ min@@ ded of the day when i left my village in eth@@ iop@@ ia and went away together with my brother .
and the journey to that place of understanding and accep@@ tan@@ ce has been an interesting one for me , and it &apos;s given me an insi@@ ght into the whole notion of self , which i think is worth sharing with you today .
but from about the age of five , i was aware that i didn &apos;t fit .
my dy@@ s@@ func@@ tional self could actually plu@@ g in to another self , not my own , and it felt so good .
i still valu@@ ed self-@@ worth above all other worth , and what was there to suggest otherwise ?
i give it its due .
actor than@@ die new@@ ton tells the story of finding her &quot; o@@ th@@ ern@@ ess &quot; -- first , as a child growing up in two distin@@ ct cultures , and then as an actor playing with many different selves . a warm , wise talk , fresh from stage at ted@@ global 20@@ 11 .
and so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
a project that we &apos;ve been working on very recently is to design a new bio@@ mass power station -- so a power station that uses organic waste material .
so people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area , and use that hei@@ ght that we have to have for its function .
but how could we show these teen@@ y-@@ we@@ en@@ y things ?
there &apos;s just sil@@ ence and a cool temperature .
and by lin@@ king these together , we could have 90 percent of the site as a rain@@ forest , instead of only 10 percent of sc@@ ru@@ bby trees and bits of road around buildings .
here are a few quot@@ es indic@@ ating that : &quot; man has no nature , &quot; from the histor@@ ian jo@@ se or@@ te@@ ga y gas@@ set ; &quot; man has no instin@@ cts , &quot; from the anthropo@@ log@@ ist as@@ h@@ ley mon@@ tag@@ u ; &quot; the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and pre@@ dis@@ posed to none , &quot; from the late scientist ste@@ phen ja@@ y g@@ ould .
my favorite example is a pair of tw@@ ins , one of whom was brought up as a ca@@ tho@@ lic in a na@@ z@@ i family in germany , the other brought up in a je@@ wish family in tr@@ ini@@ dad .
well , the book came out in oc@@ tober , and nothing terrible has happened .
and a more recent one : &quot; the possibility of susta@@ ining high culture in our time is becoming increasing proble@@ ma@@ tical .
indeed , in movements of moder@@ nis@@ m and post-@@ moder@@ nis@@ m , there was visual art without beauty , liter@@ ature without narra@@ tive and p@@ lot , poetry without meter and rhy@@ me , architecture and planning without or@@ nam@@ ent , human scale , green space and natural light , music without mel@@ o@@ dy and rhyth@@ m , and cri@@ tic@@ ism without c@@ lar@@ ity , attention to a@@ es@@ the@@ tics and insi@@ ght into the human condition .
until the studies are re@@ done with adop@@ tive children , who provide an environment but not genes to their kids , we have no way of knowing whether these conclu@@ sions are val@@ id .
i &apos;m an app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce , and i work with the people who actually do the jobs in question .
lam@@ b goes on the post , she op@@ ens it up .
and al@@ bert &apos;s like , &quot; what ? &quot;
and i was re@@ min@@ ded how u@@ tter@@ ly wrong i am , so much of the time .
and now i can &apos;t get -- i can &apos;t sha@@ ke the metaphor .
because , look , i &apos;m not a social anthropo@@ log@@ ist but i have a friend who is .
probably the worst ad@@ vice i ever got .
what i mean to say is i value my safety on these crazy jobs as much as the people that i &apos;m working with , but the ones who really get it done , they &apos;re not out there talking about safety first .
it &apos;s a civil war .
your iphone without those people making the same interface , the same circu@@ it@@ ry , the same board , over and over ?

and he had his arm out@@ stre@@ t@@ ched like someone out of the app@@ r@@ enti@@ ce .
tony said that it &apos;s a lot harder to convince people you &apos;re san@@ e than it is to convince them you &apos;re crazy .
and i spoke to other experts , and they said the pin@@ stri@@ ped suit -- classi@@ c psych@@ op@@ ath .
i said , &quot; could i come and interview you in prison to find out it you &apos;re psych@@ op@@ a@@ ths ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , it &apos;s an amazing theory .
because i was des@@ per@@ ate to sho@@ ve him in a box mar@@ ked psych@@ op@@ ath .
and outside in the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or he said to me , &quot; you know what , j@@ on ?
i want to argue to you that in fact , politics and religion , which are the two primary factors -- not the so@@ le , but over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly , the primary factors -- which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely -- bor@@ der@@ ing on the ine@@ vi@@ table at this point , whether one is in fa@@ vor of that or not -- that politics and religion are , in fact , themselves better concep@@ tu@@ alized as kinds of technology , and subject to kinds of questions that we reg@@ ularly consider in the space of concep@@ tual design .
i don &apos;t want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to .
now , if islam and democracy are at present in a moment of great con@@ fron@@ tation , what does that mean ?
and they &apos;re making this argument wher@@ ever they &apos;re per@@ mit@@ ted to make it .
and one fur@@ ther@@ more has the impul@@ se to gener@@ alize , as much as possible , in defin@@ ing who that ene@@ my is .
now the ship s@@ ank between rob@@ ben island to the south and das@@ sen island to the north .
up to 1,000 people a day came to the res@@ cu@@ e center , and eventually , over the course of this res@@ cu@@ e , more than 12 and a half thousand volunte@@ ers came from all over the world to cape town to help save these birds .
so in wild@@ life res@@ cu@@ e , as in life , we learn from each previous experience , and we learn from both our success@@ es and our fail@@ ures .
and we know from follo@@ w-@@ up studies that they have lived just as long as ne@@ ver@@ -@@ o@@ iled penguins , and b@@ red nearly as success@@ fully .
a personal story , a collective tri@@ um@@ ph : dy@@ an den@@ a@@ pol@@ i tells the story of the world &apos;s largest volunte@@ er animal res@@ cu@@ e , which saved more than 4@@ 0,000 penguins after an oil sp@@ ill off the coast of south africa . how does a job this big get done ? pengu@@ in by pengu@@ in by pengu@@ in ... &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
now , let &apos;s imagine those pl@@ ates ag@@ it@@ ated with community actions around food .
and then , because we know we &apos;ve got vege@@ table tou@@ ri@@ sts and we love them to bits and they &apos;re absolutely fantastic , we thought , what could we do to give them an even better experience ?
this is not a movement for those people that are going to sort themselves out anyway .
through an organic process , through an increasing recogni@@ tion of the power of small actions , we are starting , at last , to believe in ourselves again , and to believe in our capacity , each and every one of us , to build a different and a kinder future , and in my book , that &apos;s incredible .
the word &quot; belief &quot; itself origin@@ ally meant to love , to prize , to hold de@@ ar .
go and study it . &quot;
because the gol@@ den rule is difficult . i sometimes -- when i &apos;m speaking to con@@ gre@@ ga@@ tions about compassion , i sometimes see a mu@@ tin@@ ous expression cros@@ sing some of their faces because a lot of religious people pre@@ fer to be right , rather than com@@ passionate .
and everybody is sho@@ cked when the old man takes off his head co@@ vering and shows himself .
so i want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view , and this world i &apos;m going to talk about is the mi@@ cr@@ o world .
this is a ring of co@@ bal@@ t atoms .
and the reason that is , is because in a place like this island , a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the re@@ ef@@ s provide a place where all these micro@@ scop@@ ic animals or ma@@ cro@@ scop@@ ic animals grow , and when they die , their sh@@ ells and their teeth and their b@@ ones break up and they make gra@@ ins of sand , things like coral and so forth .
this was the first picture i took . it was kind of amazing .
that image was the start of the x-@@ ray technology .
we all look the same inside , believe me .
the walls are 700 milli@@ meters th@@ ick of soli@@ d den@@ se con@@ cre@@ te .
the one on the left is an x-@@ ray .
it has human con@@ not@@ ations .
so the x-@@ ray will show the over@@ la@@ ps in these little cor@@ ners .
so , i &apos;ve got to saw the car in half , down the middle , not an easy task , in itself .
we know this because they did an experiment . &quot;
now rein@@ car@@ nation , that &apos;s another thing gone -- the after@@ life .
it is basically moment@@ um to energy where the four@@ -@@ v@@ ec@@ tor is const@@ ant -- that &apos;s what it is .
i stopped obser@@ ving the house for a moment , and when i started obser@@ ving again , everything had happened . &quot;
and in a poin@@ t@@ less universe , that , to me , is a wonderful thing .
no , don &apos;t just give me an example .
tony lear@@ ns about the on@@ t@@ ologi@@ cally promis@@ cu@@ ous , the epi@@ ste@@ m@@ ologi@@ cally an@@ xi@@ ous , the eth@@ ically du@@ bi@@ ous , the meta@@ physi@@ cally ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
it wasn &apos;t the only passion i had .
so i looked at the cul@@ tiv@@ ation of information as if it were food and said , so we were h@@ unter@@ -@@ ga@@ thers of information .
cla@@ y shir@@ ky once st@@ ated that there is no such animal as information over@@ load , there is only filter failure .
so o@@ bi@@ ang j@@ uni@@ or , well , he bu@@ ys himself a $ 30 million man@@ sion in mali@@ b@@ u , california .
and in the years that i &apos;ve been , and we &apos;ve all been campaig@@ ning and investig@@ ating , i &apos;ve repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly seen that what makes corruption on a global , massive scale possible , well it isn &apos;t just gre@@ ed or the mis@@ use of power or that ne@@ bul@@ ous phr@@ ase &quot; we@@ ak govern@@ ance . &quot;
and is this progress ? maybe , but we &apos;re going to be keeping a very close eye on that case .
and now for@@ give me , i &apos;m going to read the next bit because it &apos;s a very live issue , and our law@@ yers have been through this in some detail and they want me to get it right .
thank you .
you &apos;re a he@@ ter@@ o@@ sexual or a homo@@ sexual , or you never have sex .
i &apos;ve met women and men all over this planet , who through various circum@@ stances -- war , poverty , ra@@ c@@ ism , multiple forms of violence -- have never known security , or have had their illusion of security forever de@@ va@@ st@@ ated .
and in this meeting -- it went on for weeks in the press , two weeks where there was huge discussion .
she said , &quot; if you help me get money , i could open a house . &quot;
and how are you doing ? are you ex@@ hau@@ sted ?
ladies and gentle@@ men , i have de@@ vot@@ ed the past 25 years of my life to designing books .
and l@@ o and beh@@ old , soon enough , i was able to put this theory to the test on two books that i was working on for kno@@ pf .
well , they used it .
what does that mean ?
hu@@ h@@ h ! they &apos;ve been discovered by the su@@ l@@ tan .
when it &apos;s on top of the paper board , which is the opposite , it forms this .
the tra@@ its the word chil@@ dis@@ h add@@ res@@ ses are seen so often in adults that we should abo@@ li@@ sh this a@@ ge-@@ dis@@ crimin@@ atory word when it comes to cri@@ ti@@ ci@@ zing behavior associated with ir@@ responsibility and ir@@ rational thinking .
if i dou@@ bt my older sister &apos;s ability to pay back the 10 percent interest i establi@@ shed on her last lo@@ an , i &apos;m going to with@@ hold her ability to get more money from me until she pa@@ ys it back .
but the way progress happens is because new generations and new er@@ as grow and develop and become better than the previous ones .
the bi@@ op@@ hon@@ y is all of the sound that &apos;s gener@@ ated by organisms in a given habit@@ at at one time and in one place .
well , a year later i re@@ turned , and using the same proto@@ col@@ s and recor@@ ding under the same conditions , i recor@@ ded a number of examples of the same da@@ wn ch@@ or@@ uses , and now this is what we &apos;ve got .
i want to end with a story told by a be@@ a@@ ver .
my mother wanted me to be a den@@ ti@@ st .
we were progra@@ mming in basic , which is a pretty awful language for games , so we ended up learning assem@@ bly language so we could really take control of the hard@@ ware .
now , chris did ask me to bring some statistics with me , so i &apos;ve done that .
this market is now esti@@ ma@@ ted at over 800 million dollars an@@ nu@@ ally .
throughout human history people have played games .
when my parents bought my sister and i our first n@@ inten@@ do , whatever in@@ her@@ ent addi@@ ctive quality this early inter@@ active electr@@ onic enter@@ tainment pos@@ s@@ essed quickly took hold of me .
the people who create these games are smart .
when i am driving down a road at sun@@ set all i can think is , this is almost as beautiful as my games are .
who is that going to come from ?
and as the student video showed , we can impact and move .
they measure very , very carefully .
so the ro@@ sl@@ ings have been able to do simpli@@ city without re@@ moving what &apos;s important about the data .
and so si@@ x-@@ year-old lau@@ ren there noticed that the first one took one , and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one , the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one , and then the next one .
see this whe@@ el &apos;s head@@ ing here ?
we get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the ch@@ ase .
i believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface , and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expen@@ di@@ ture of about 100 million dollars .
life is short , you know .
before it &apos;s all done we are going to alter ourselves every bit as much as we have changed the world around us .
that &apos;s going to have amazing im@@ pac@@ ts .
why do you do what you do ?
they &apos;ll want the new rele@@ ase .
that is simply not going to happen .
and i don &apos;t think that &apos;s what &apos;s going to happen .
it &apos;s how we look at it .
so i said , &quot; yes . &quot;
because she knows that i adop@@ ted her and that i can &apos;t have kids .
so i go , &quot; you know , why don &apos;t we go on the internet , and maybe we can see ... like on wikipedia . &quot;
the thought of the war@@ far@@ in was really quite fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing .
this , like i say , is a c@@ ad model of me , and this is one of the later c@@ ad models .
even tri@@ ps to the den@@ ti@@ st require that you take antibio@@ tics , in case you get an intern@@ al infe@@ ction on the val@@ ve .
so one needs to be care@@ ful with discipl@@ in@@ ary conven@@ tions .
j@@ ar@@ g@@ on is a huge problem when you &apos;re trying to work across discipl@@ ines , because in an engineering world , we all understand c@@ ad and r@@ .@@ p@@ . -- not in the medical world .
the good news is the benefits are st@@ on@@ k@@ ingly huge .
ladies and gentle@@ men , the world has gotten smaller .
so i was carto@@ oning live on a wide screen -- it was quite a sen@@ sation -- and then this guy came to me .
they were used first by a dan@@ ish newspaper , which wanted to make a point on islam .
so this is really journ@@ alism in carto@@ ons .
show the positive power of carto@@ ons .
i think we all always have the choice in the end not to do the bad thing .
two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years in the making .
i mean , there we are .
how long did it take to go from one system to the next ?
but is this true ?
something else is , because if that doesn &apos;t survive , we are not here ; there are no ma@@ mm@@ als . it &apos;s that close ; one species e@@ kes through .
and the last three years have seen an enormous break@@ through in a br@@ and-@@ new field .
all right , what &apos;s the con@@ sequence ? the oceans probably turn pur@@ ple .
&quot; i believe we are seeing in this response the result of ma@@ mm@@ als and re@@ p@@ ti@@ les having under@@ gone a series of ex@@ pos@@ ures to h@@ 2@@ s . &quot;
how many of us have gone through our entire k@@ yo@@ to quot@@ a just for flying this year ?
children have been traff@@ i@@ cked from other conflict z@@ ones to come and work on the coffee plan@@ tations .
you want to see the classi@@ c swe@@ at@@ shop , meet me at ma@@ dis@@ on square garden , i &apos;ll take you down the street , and i &apos;ll show you a chinese swe@@ at@@ shop .
so governments who are fail@@ ing , who are dro@@ pping the ball at a national level , have even less ability to get their arms around the problem at an international level .
we &apos;ll apply that throughout our global supply chain re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of ow@@ ner@@ ship or control .
you &apos;ll say , &quot; how can we trust them ? &quot;
could the private sector and n@@ gos get together and mar@@ sha@@ l a response ?
please ask them to treat us like human beings . &quot;
i want her to look at the world through the under@@ side of a glas@@ s-@@ bottom boat , to look through a micro@@ scope at the galaxies that exist on the pin@@ point of a human mind , because that &apos;s the way my mom taught me .
i know that je@@ an-@@ lu@@ c go@@ dar@@ d was right when he said that , &quot; a good story has a beginning , a middle and an end , although not necessarily in that order . &quot;
i discovered this bar on manhattan &apos;s lower east side that ho@@ sted a wee@@ k@@ ly poetry open mic , and my be@@ wil@@ dered , but suppor@@ tive , parents took me to so@@ ak in every o@@ un@@ ce of spo@@ ken word that i could .
but it turns out sometimes , poetry can be really sc@@ ary .
now i know that the number one rule to being cool is to seem un@@ fa@@ zed , to never ad@@ mit that anything sc@@ ar@@ es you or impres@@ ses you or exc@@ ites you .
but you don &apos;t get to start on step three , until you take step one first : i can .
so no matter that i have in@@ hi@@ bi@@ tions to fill all my po@@ ckets , i keep trying , hop@@ ing that one day i &apos;ll write a po@@ em i can be proud to let sit in a museum exhi@@ bit as the only pro@@ of i exi@@ sted .
thank you .
society &apos;s problems can &apos;t be solved until they &apos;re identi@@ fied .
a bedro@@ om , the place where people share inti@@ ma@@ cy , where life itself is conc@@ ei@@ ved , became a bat@@ t@@ le@@ field .
this man was in an n@@ go fe@@ eding center , being helped as much as he could be helped .
children who couldn &apos;t be suppor@@ ted by their families were raised in government or@@ phan@@ ages .
my pictures can play a suppor@@ ting role to the work of n@@ gos by she@@ d@@ ding light on the critical social problems they &apos;re trying to deal with .
a market@@ place was hit by a mor@@ t@@ ar sh@@ ell that killed several members of a single family .
we all understand why we have elec@@ tions , and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote .
how do we make an ele@@ ction system completely ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able while keeping the vot@@ es absolutely secret ?
they can check that all the vot@@ es were coun@@ ted cor@@ rec@@ tly .
i will tell you by the end of my speech .
the reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies .
whereas with islam as a majority religion and chri@@ sti@@ an@@ ity , you see countries all the way .
well we know quite well what is needed in these countries .
i stron@@ g@@ ly re@@ com@@ men@@ d mel@@ in@@ da gates &apos; last ted@@ talk .
because before 19@@ 80 , there were much fewer people born than there were during the last 30 years .
they are difficult to watch , but you should look at them with optimis@@ m because the hor@@ ror of these pictures will be mat@@ ched by the u@@ pli@@ f@@ ting quality of knowing that they no longer exist .
audience : early dete@@ ction , early response .
and he@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ gic small@@ po@@ x , the most cru@@ el of all , which had a predi@@ le@@ ction for preg@@ nant women .
we raised the reward . we continu@@ ed to increase the reward .
and we condu@@ cted the first ne@@ p@@ al survey ever done for health , and the first nation@@ wide blin@@ dness survey ever done , and we had aston@@ ishing results .
and it &apos;s getting worse because travel is getting so much better .
small@@ po@@ x -- early dete@@ ction , early response .
l@@ b : well , you know , as r@@ on st . john -- i hope you &apos;ll go and meet him in the dinner after@@ wards and talk to him -- when he started g@@ ph@@ in -- in 199@@ 7 , there was an out@@ break of bird flu .
i set up a climate change n@@ go called the climate group .
it &apos;s about what we do right here , right now , and for the rest of our working lives .
they were mis@@ -@@ sold for more than a hundred years .
y@@ i@@ el@@ ds increase , and you hal@@ ve the input costs .
and why not take control of it ourselves ?
you know the phr@@ ase , you can manage what you measure ?
steve howard : let &apos;s go all@@ -@@ in on selling sustain@@ ability
now when the my@@ stic part of me j@@ ab@@ bers on and on like this , the war@@ ri@@ or roll@@ s her eyes .
and i realize we &apos;re all bus@@ y people , so don &apos;t worry , you can do this on a lunch break .
i asked her why her side makes such ou@@ trage@@ ous alle@@ ga@@ tions and lies about my side .
my name is r@@ y@@ an lo@@ bo , and i &apos;ve been involved in the docum@@ ent@@ ary film@@ making business all over the world for the last 10 years .
and he is probably the most pro@@ li@@ fic mass mur@@ derer alive on earth today .
the second story i &apos;m going to tell you about is about a group of very special fighting women with rather unique pe@@ ac@@ e-@@ keeping skills .
as we ne@@ ared , an@@ gry crow@@ ds attac@@ ked our tru@@ cks and st@@ oned them , by hundreds of people all over the place .
sometimes , foc@@ using on what &apos;s hero@@ ic , beautiful and dig@@ ni@@ fied , re@@ gar@@ d@@ less of the context , can help magni@@ fy these in@@ tan@@ gi@@ bles three ways , in the pro@@ tag@@ on@@ ist of the story , in the audience , and also in the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller .
can you tell us what you le@@ ak@@ ed and what happened ?
let me know when you &apos;ve got them . let &apos;s sho@@ ot .
he has been char@@ ged , about five days ago , with ob@@ ta@@ ining 1@@ 50,000 c@@ ables and rele@@ as@@ ing 50 .
actually , they &apos;re not . my son isn &apos;t . how d@@ are you ? &quot;
i mean it &apos;s an intri@@ gu@@ ing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
i mean , like any sort of growing star@@ tu@@ p organization , we are sort of over@@ wh@@ el@@ med by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quanti@@ ty of whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clo@@ sur@@ es of a very high c@@ ali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information .
capable , gener@@ ous men do not create vic@@ ti@@ ms ; they nur@@ ture vic@@ ti@@ ms ?
that &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in -- because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
that means that it is the numbers that control the form , not me .
the other reason why i really like this is because it off@@ ers an alternative ent@@ ry point into the complexity of science .
and later in biology class , i learned that it &apos;s due to a process called den@@ atur@@ ing , which is where the proteins will change shape and lose their ability to chemi@@ cally function .
is it worth it to you ?
che@@ mo@@ therapy , one of the most effective ways used to treat cancer today , invol@@ ves giving patients really high do@@ ses of chemicals to try and kill off cancer cells .
and ever since then , i &apos;ve gotten to do some pretty cool stuff -- from getting to meet the president to getting to be on this stage to talk to all of you guys .
so today i want to show you my inter@@ active software model that i created .
and that saying is that gene@@ tics lo@@ ads the gun , but the environment pul@@ ls the tri@@ g@@ ger .
&quot; no , no , no ! should be a fro@@ g ! &quot;
and the conversation would go something like this , &quot; you know ai@@ mee , you &apos;re very attra@@ ctive .
then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a po@@ ta@@ to ro@@ ot system growing in them , and be@@ et@@ roots out the top , and a very lo@@ vely br@@ ass to@@ e .
it can stand as a symbol that the we@@ ar@@ er has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space .
well , being different is not that difficult .
but then we are also so fortun@@ ate to wit@@ ness the transformation of the whole country .
the most popular blog@@ ger -- it &apos;s not me -- it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9@@ .@@ 5 million follo@@ wers , or fan@@ s .
they work for longer hours with less income , less social wel@@ f@@ are .
we heard about pollu@@ ted air , pollu@@ ted water , po@@ is@@ oned food .
so happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
and the only way to film that is a sho@@ ot from the air .
and what was amazing about that discovery is that it also solved the myster@@ y of what pol@@ lin@@ ated a unique flo@@ wer .
some 1,@@ 500 miles south of the tro@@ pic@@ s , between chi@@ le and bo@@ li@@ via , the and@@ es completely change .
this is a picture of culture .
now , at that time , the enti@@ ty , the legal car@@ tel , that controlled the performance rights for most of the music that would be broad@@ cast using these technologies was as@@ ca@@ p .
there &apos;s only you in my life ...
you &apos;re a tr@@ es@@ pas@@ ser with about as much sense as these people were tr@@ es@@ pas@@ s@@ ers .
we made mix@@ ed ta@@ pes ; they re@@ mix music .
and the song began to move on i understand like this .
i watch that tv show &apos; lie to me . &apos; i know you &apos;re lying . &quot;
this c@@ on man , henry ober@@ lan@@ der , he was such an effective c@@ on man british auth@@ ori@@ ties say he could have under@@ min@@ ed the entire ban@@ king system of the western world .
we &apos;re deeply ambi@@ valent about the truth .
by the time you enter college , you &apos;re going to lie to your mom in one out of every five inter@@ actions .
now if bill clin@@ ton had said , &quot; well , to tell you the truth ... &quot; or richard ni@@ x@@ on &apos;s favorite , &quot; in all c@@ and@@ or ... &quot; he would have been a dead gi@@ ve@@ away for any li@@ es@@ po@@ tter than knows that quali@@ fying language , as it &apos;s called , quali@@ fying language like that , further dis@@ cre@@ di@@ ts the subject .
now i know it seems really obvious , but when you &apos;re having a conversation with someone you sus@@ pe@@ ct of de@@ ception , at@@ titude is by far the most over@@ looked but telling of indi@@ cat@@ ors .
so i know it &apos;s not possible .
we &apos;re human beings .
but i know she looked at you with those amazing brown eyes , and you still wanted to kill her .
i just heard the best jo@@ ke about bon@@ d emer@@ u@@ wa .
we don &apos;t go home at the end of the day and think , &quot; well , i really know who i am now because the wall street journ@@ al says that the stock exchange closed at this many points . &quot;
language is not -- i mean , things don &apos;t have any mu@@ table value by themselves ; we as@@ cri@@ be them a value .
my father was educ@@ ated in cor@@ k , in the university of cor@@ k , in the &apos; 5@@ 0s .
now for those of you who have seen me at the bu@@ ff@@ et tables know that it was because it was co@@ sting them too much to feed me .
the question is , how do i balance narra@@ tives that are wonderful with narra@@ tives of wo@@ unds and self-@@ lo@@ a@@ thing ?
i want to believe that we can be ag@@ no@@ stic about this , that we can rise above all of this .
ka@@ -@@ do@@ o@@ o@@ om .
well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um development goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the inno@@ v@@ ators , and those inno@@ v@@ ators come from every single sector .
so what &apos;s the second thing that co@@ ke &apos;s good at ?
so what &apos;s the next step for eth@@ iop@@ ia ?
well , it &apos;s based on avo@@ i@@ dance , not as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions .
now , it &apos;s not just a funny head@@ line -- it &apos;s innovative . it &apos;s an innovative marketing campaign .
by aug@@ ust 3@@ 0@@ th , a genetic test was done , and we knew what stra@@ in of polio sh@@ ri@@ ra@@ m had .
so if co@@ ke &apos;s marke@@ ters came to me and asked me to define happiness , i &apos;d say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms .
we did 250 hours of di@@ ving here in 2005 .
the good news is that , in addition to having more pre@@ dat@@ ors , there &apos;s more of everything .
one very clear way is the marine prote@@ cted areas , especially no@@ -@@ take reser@@ ves that we set asi@@ de to allow for the re@@ co@@ very for marine life .
these are eg@@ g cases la@@ id by a sna@@ il off the coast of chi@@ le , and this is how many eg@@ gs they lay on the bottom .
and the fis@@ her@@ men were auth@@ ori@@ zed to catch 30 percent of the entire spa@@ w@@ ning population every year .
the problem is that we can create these large reser@@ ves only in places where there are no people , where there is no social conflict , where the political cost is really low and the economic cost is also low .
how could 85 percent survive on 15 percent ?
the last one &apos;s a personal question .
most of the animals are in the oceans .
the bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ c@@ ence -- they use the lights for attra@@ cting mates and attra@@ cting pre@@ y and communic@@ ating .
we &apos;re going to take a jo@@ y@@ stick , sit in front of our computer , on the earth , and press the jo@@ y@@ stick forward , and fly around the planet .
this is one of these hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents .
their foot is at about 200 degrees c and their head is out at three degrees c , so it &apos;s like having your hand in bo@@ iling water and your foot in free@@ zing water .
those are all sh@@ ri@@ mp .
i think this is the ne@@ at@@ est@@ -@@ looking thing .
there &apos;s a story in the sea , in the wat@@ ers of the sea , in the se@@ di@@ ments and the ro@@ cks of the sea floor .
so there &apos;s a useful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about students that i see , a useful ster@@ e@@ ot@@ yp@@ e about you all .
i am very concerned about this because i &apos;m going to reti@@ re in a world that my students will run .
so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
does the color of the val@@ ve matter ? what matters here ? &quot;
so i &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-@@ inst@@ all@@ ed with these viruses day one of the class .
what ever happened to the small ha@@ dr@@ on colli@@ der ?
almost all of that growth will be in places like mon@@ key h@@ ill .
that &apos;s where mau@@ re@@ en went to school .
the reason they went on studying was this .
you need to start education from things that make a difference to them in their sett@@ ings .
well , you create your own teachers .
he &apos;s actually a trade union organi@@ zer by background , and that &apos;s how he learned the skills to build his organization .
and this is just a very simple way of understanding what kind of innovation , what kind of different design we need .
we need more of that completely new and radical thinking .
he was in a movie called &quot; tor@@ ch song tri@@ log@@ y . &quot;
i get stuck in traffic -- evil , evil traffic .
how many people out there are in love ? anyone in love out there ?
what do they want ? &quot;
non@@ eth@@ eless , our fore@@ fa@@ thers , right ?
we keep doing this over and over again .
and i have come to find that a more appropriate metaphor for aging is a sta@@ ir@@ case -- the up@@ ward as@@ cen@@ sion of the human spirit , bringing us into wisdom , wh@@ ol@@ eness and auth@@ en@@ tic@@ ity .
and there isn &apos;t much we can do about that .
perhaps they weren &apos;t able to love us beyond how we per@@ formed in the world .
this is what determin@@ es the quality of the life we &apos;ve lived -- not whether we &apos;ve been rich or poor , famous or un@@ known , healthy or suffering .
there are a quar@@ ter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quar@@ ter of a million species of flo@@ wer@@ ing plants .
sometimes that sym@@ bio@@ sis has led to wonderful adap@@ tations -- the hum@@ m@@ ing@@ bird ha@@ w@@ k-@@ mot@@ h is beautiful in its adap@@ tation .
so it probably even feels good for the inse@@ ct , as well as looking good .
i photograph@@ ed this thing last week in dor@@ set .
but if you look at the spectrum , birds and us , we see red , green and blue and see that spectrum .
that &apos;s the main use of that filter .
so this was an amazing experience , and again , yes , it was a game , but they didn &apos;t write newspaper artic@@ les , people didn &apos;t say -- you know , really , &quot; i can die now because the red so@@ x won . &quot; and many people did .
and i thought , that &apos;s it ? and so , you know , this is the middle pas@@ sage , this is an incredibly significant event , and she &apos;s tre@@ ating it like , basically some black people went on a cru@@ ise , is more or less how it sounds to her .
i was so excited . it was like , i &apos;d been making games for 20@@ -@@ some years , and then i decided to do it again .
we &apos;re colle@@ cting and creating all kinds of data about how we &apos;re living our lives , and it &apos;s en@@ ab@@ ling us to tell some amazing stories .
so zo@@ om@@ ing back out real quick , we see , again , the u.s. -- you get florida down in the ri@@ ght-@@ hand corner .
some of you may recognize this .
i think it was really interesting to ju@@ x@@ ta@@ pose this humanity versus this massive distribu@@ ted gri@@ d .
so there were no longer sho@@ e makers , but now there are people sla@@ pping sol@@ es on people &apos;s shoes .
when ha@@ l &apos;s dying at the end of the film he starts sing@@ ing this song , as a re@@ ference to when computers became human .
this is actually two of my favor@@ ites : the p@@ in-@@ board tho@@ m yor@@ ke and a le@@ go tho@@ m yor@@ ke .
collabor@@ ator six : watching the video in my room , i could see me not understanding at the beginning of it .
and we wanted to push the idea of the music video that was meant for the web beyond the four@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ three or si@@ x@@ te@@ en-@@ b@@ y-@@ nine window and try to make it play out and ch@@ ore@@ ogra@@ ph throughout the screen .
i moved for two years in ta@@ i@@ w@@ an .
so one of these works is the &quot; sp@@ elling spi@@ der . &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s a global view , to see our common roots and how we can use them to catch dreams .
&quot; flo@@ ating is@@ lands . &quot;
you have people r@@ enting their wings in the hea@@ v@@ ens .
i made an artist book that &apos;s in sta@@ in@@ less steel instead of paper .
so in au@@ r@@ or@@ a , col@@ or@@ a@@ do it &apos;s a ben@@ ch .
i don &apos;t know the stories .
it exists . what is a s@@ no@@ b ?
we &apos;ve done away with the ca@@ ste system .
and the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in boo@@ k@@ sh@@ ops .
is there any re@@ lief from some of these pres@@ sur@@ es that i &apos;ve just been out@@ lin@@ ing ?
what we fear is the jud@@ gment and ridi@@ cule of others . and it exists .
he is not a lo@@ ser , though he has lost .
you can &apos;t be successful at everything .
and that a society that encoura@@ ges that perhaps has to have some w@@ inn@@ ers and los@@ ers .
and i couldn &apos;t for@@ give myself for the coun@@ t@@ less , coun@@ t@@ less hours i had lost in negative thought -- all the time i had spent be@@ ating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopp@@ ing the sexual ab@@ use when i was a kid and career moves and this and this and this .
it &apos;s 14 hours 5@@ 8 minutes . who car@@ es the last two minutes ? &quot;
you save the french for last .
but no , two hours in , wh@@ am ! never in my life ...
the doctor , medical team from university of mi@@ ami arrived at five in the morning .
well there was no gr@@ in and be@@ aring this .
i wouldn &apos;t mind if every one of you came up on this stage ton@@ ight and told us how you &apos;ve gotten over the big dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ments of your lives .
and by the way , a repor@@ ter called me the other day and he said he looked on wikipedia and he said he saw my birth@@ day was aug@@ ust 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d 194@@ 9 , and for some od@@ d reason in wikipedia , they had my death date too .
this is already available today .
and this sen@@ ds a signal and it creates a body area network to a g@@ ate@@ way .
and this wired magazine cover article really cap@@ tured a lot of this ; it talked a lot about the ni@@ ke sho@@ e and how quickly that &apos;s been adop@@ ted to monit@@ or exercise physi@@ ology and energy expen@@ di@@ ture .
who would ever have thought you could have your own ee@@ g at your home , tag@@ ged to a very nice al@@ arm clock , by the way ?
it &apos;s like a managed competition of sleep .
and this article from the econom@@ ist su@@ mm@@ ed it up beauti@@ fully about the opportunities in health across the developing world : &quot; mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people , more quickly , than any previous technology . &quot;
and finally , another example : sudden car@@ di@@ a@@ c death .
so if you really want to solve the problem of epide@@ mi@@ cs and so forth , let &apos;s start with that . and since i got that idea , i &apos;ve had to sha@@ ke hundreds of hands .
they &apos;re both wonderful and lar@@ gely the same , except that computers happened in between .
and whatever you do , don &apos;t read anything about gene@@ tics that &apos;s published within your lifetime , or something .
this is a problem of such and such a type , and therefore there &apos;s a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem .
a guy in england called he@@ ston blu@@ men@@ th@@ al , he &apos;s developed his a@@ v@@ ant@@ -@@ gar@@ de cu@@ is@@ ine .
and each of these text blocks explains a key thing that &apos;s going on .
i said , &quot; it would have to show up free . &quot;
it turned out he was hi@@ red by a scot@@ tish dist@@ il@@ ler@@ y to understand why they were burning so dam@@ n much pe@@ at to di@@ still the wh@@ is@@ key .
the po@@ p@@ cor@@ n is illu@@ str@@ ating a key thing in physics .
and tre@@ ph@@ ination is simply just cutting a hole in the sk@@ ul@@ l .
these were folks that travel@@ ed from village to village , town to town , doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art .
with the patient in@@ sensitive to pain , and a ster@@ i@@ le operating field all be@@ ts were off , the sky was the li@@ mit .
and one of the reasons why it is so hard is because the ex@@ ternal er@@ gon@@ om@@ ics are terrible .
but once you &apos;ve got it , your proce@@ d@@ ure costs do come down .
but what this lets you do is gives you that all@@ -@@ important tra@@ ction , and counter@@ -@@ tra@@ ction , so that you can dis@@ se@@ ct , so that you can se@@ w , so that you can do all the things that you need to do , all the sur@@ gical tas@@ ks .
and we can look at cells directly .
when we think about acci@@ dents , we usually consider them to be har@@ m@@ ful , un@@ fortun@@ ate or even dangerous , and they certainly can be .
any@@ how , we were curious and hop@@ e@@ ful and still wanted to give it a go .
and this is only one of the examples of the many acci@@ dents that happened during our experim@@ entation .
we hope that in the near future , we &apos;ll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only ph@@ th@@ al@@ ates but a wide variety of different cont@@ am@@ in@@ ants .
this is the land .
but it &apos;s not about them becoming bon@@ o or tra@@ cy chap@@ man .
because it &apos;s like as bill clin@@ ton was saying about r@@ wand@@ an health clin@@ ics .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style is gri@@ ds . let &apos;s make the chair gri@@ d@@ dy . &quot;
design was not something other .
also ro@@ de on one . i ...
so you can actually visit and have this three-@@ dimensional fic@@ tional experience there .
at the same time that charles was doing that chair , he was doing this film .
and i also want to share this one .
i went to five countries around the world .
being nu@@ mer@@ ous does not make you a sla@@ ve .
and we &apos;re also jo@@ ined by br@@ ent law@@ son from law@@ son fr@@ is@@ k se@@ curi@@ ties .
capital pur@@ ch@@ ase it@@ em@@ s .
and in a way , without us even notic@@ ing , has ended up standing on the pre@@ ci@@ pi@@ ce of its own extin@@ ction , waiting for us to give it a big boot and kno@@ ck it over . and get rid of it .
four million people were li@@ f@@ ted up out of sla@@ very and then du@@ mp@@ ed .

and these str@@ ands of magnetic field inside the super@@ conduc@@ tor , they come in dis@@ cre@@ te quanti@@ ties .
but how many flu@@ x@@ ons , how many magnetic str@@ ands are there in a single dis@@ k like this ?
amazing . thank you .
he had mis@@ heard me and thought i was coming up because i was trying to make a poster , and so wasn &apos;t prepared to take me into the min@@ es .
as you can see , it &apos;s got lots and lots of miner@@ als dis@@ solved in it .
so i looked up a plastic -- so i decided that i could mine some of this moder@@ n-@@ day rock .
and it &apos;s not just compu@@ tation .
when that comes to an end we &apos;ll go to the si@@ x@@ th paradig@@ m ; three-@@ dimensional self-@@ organi@@ zing molecular circu@@ its .
the amount of dna data we &apos;ve sequen@@ ced has dou@@ bled every year .
and we &apos;re only eight dou@@ bl@@ ings away from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs .
then we are going to apply them to the other areas , like energy , ec@@ ology , policy law and eth@@ ics , entreprene@@ ur@@ ship , so that people can bring these new technologies to the world .
he said he &apos;d lived his whole life there by the beach , and that he would rather die there than run .
i should war@@ n you , they &apos;re pretty powerful .
and this is -- at least , to a traditional econom@@ ist -- some@@ what remarkable , because the traditional account of economic man would say that , basically , you do things for a con@@ cre@@ te reward , pri@@ mar@@ ily financial .
and this is a very challen@@ ging idea . it &apos;s a very challen@@ ging idea to main@@ stream media . it &apos;s a very challen@@ ging idea to anyone who has invest@@ ed an enormous amount of time and exper@@ ti@@ se , and who has a lot of energy invest@@ ed in the notion that he or she knows better than everyone else .
a lot of people talk about ants .
i said , &quot; look , you &apos;re nu@@ ts . that technology &apos;s just not available right now .
so i &apos;m going to show you now , without the skin on it , a 3@@ 0-@@ second piece , and then i &apos;m done .
this type of habit@@ at co@@ vers more of the earth &apos;s surface than all other habit@@ ats combin@@ ed .
now most of us , and i would say me inclu@@ ded , think that human explo@@ it@@ ation of the oceans really only became very serious in the last 50 to , perhaps , 100 years or so .
so these are te@@ ther@@ ed vehi@@ cles we lower down to the sea floor where they &apos;re our eyes and our hands for working on the sea bottom .
and so there &apos;s a bar@@ code on that product that tells the computer exactly what the product is .
so what did we find ?
this is a location in the pacific where white shar@@ k conver@@ ge .
but the fis@@ hes , as i say , are the best known .
and that &apos;s the deep sea , that &apos;s the environment that we consider to be among the most pri@@ st@@ ine left on earth .
right now , america is in an un@@ re@@ mit@@ ting state of trau@@ ma .
it could have been an english tu@@ d@@ or or span@@ ish col@@ oni@@ al , but we kind of cho@@ se this shape .
if there are 15 oper@@ ations , you know that none of them work .
what i mean is this ability that each of us has to be something greater than her@@ self or himself ; to ar@@ ise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of .
it comes ini@@ tially from the la@@ tin pati@@ or , to end@@ ure , or to suff@@ er .
now you may reason that we have one to percei@@ ve the world or to think , and that &apos;s completely wrong .
if you p@@ it g@@ ary k@@ as@@ par@@ o@@ v here , when he &apos;s not in ja@@ il , against ib@@ m &apos;s deep blue , well the answer is ib@@ m &apos;s deep blue will occasi@@ on@@ ally win .
it &apos;s a high school sport where you have 12 cu@@ ps you have to st@@ ack and un@@ st@@ ack against the clock in a pres@@ cri@@ bed order .
now what i want to convince you of is the brain also goes through a lot of effort to reduce the negative consequences of this sort of noise and vari@@ ability .
imagine you &apos;re learning to play ten@@ nis and you want to decide where the ball is going to boun@@ ce as it comes over the net towards you .
well why would i bo@@ ther doing that ?
and we re@@ play that to the other hand with a time del@@ ay .
so if they re@@ tali@@ ate with the same force , the first person will think it &apos;s been es@@ cal@@ ated .
and there &apos;s a big gap between the task and the movement system .
here are two possible pa@@ ths to that ball .
d@@ w : no , no , actually i think they &apos;re all important to drive the right movement behavior to get re@@ production in the end .
this is a com@@ posite taken by vi@@ king in 197@@ 6 .
there are regi@@ ons on mars , where , for some reason -- we don &apos;t understand why at this point -- the surface is very , very highly magne@@ ti@@ zed .
this is a measu@@ re@@ ment we ob@@ ta@@ ined a few years ago from a mar@@ s-@@ or@@ bit@@ ing satelli@@ te called o@@ dy@@ s@@ sey .
this is mars path@@ fin@@ der . this is pho@@ en@@ i@@ x , we just put two years ago .
but , of equal importance , as we fly through the atmosphere of mars , we trans@@ mit that journey , the first flight of an airplane outside of the earth , we trans@@ mit those images back to earth .
a lot of he@@ ating , fri@@ c@@ tional he@@ ating . it &apos;s going 18 thousand miles an hour .
there &apos;s actually no hon@@ or@@ ari@@ um for anyone for this thing .
tor@@ ture , very funny .
so then you really get into it , and you &apos;re like , &quot; well , the le@@ go people in den@@ mark , they &apos;ve got all this software to let you build your own virtu@@ ally . &quot;
anyway , i &apos;m out of time .
for this climate crisis , we assem@@ bled a network , really , of super@@ stars , from policy activi@@ sts to scientists and entreprene@@ urs and business leaders . fif@@ ty or so of them .
wal@@ -@@ m@@ art has over 1@@ 25 million u.s. custom@@ ers .
so , eight of us went to sac@@ ra@@ men@@ to in aug@@ ust and we met with the seven un@@ decided leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and we lo@@ b@@ bi@@ ed for ab@@ 32 .
that &apos;s 10 percent of the co2 emissions across their entire country .
and that &apos;s why we &apos;re invest@@ ing 200 million dollars in a wide range of really dis@@ rup@@ tive new technologies for innovation in green technologies .
when i was in da@@ v@@ os , china &apos;s ma@@ yo@@ r of d@@ ali@@ an was pres@@ sed about their co2 strategy , and he said the following , &quot; you know , americans use seven times the co2 per capit@@ a as chinese . &quot;
&quot; i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it , &quot; john do@@ er@@ r says in an emotional talk about climate change and investment . to create a world fit for his daughter to live in , he says , we need to invest now in clean , green energy .
and the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning , let &apos;s say one or two people are infe@@ cted , or affected by the thing and then they affect , or infe@@ ct , two people , who in turn affect four , eight , 16 and so forth , and you get the epidemic growth phase of the cur@@ ve .
so , let me ask you this -- i can cul@@ tiv@@ ate this intuition by asking a question -- who would you rather be if a de@@ ad@@ ly ger@@ m was spre@@ ading through the network , a or b ?
and this , in essen@@ ce , is what &apos;s known as the friend@@ ship parado@@ x .
it could dep@@ end on the nature of the pa@@ tho@@ gen -- different pa@@ tho@@ gens , using this techni@@ que , you &apos;d get different war@@ ning -- or other phenomen@@ a that are spre@@ ading , or frank@@ ly , on the structure of the human network .
if we imm@@ uni@@ ze 9@@ 60 of them , it &apos;s as if we had imm@@ uni@@ zed a hundred &#91; percent &#93; of them .
so the tru@@ ck@@ ers are just going about their business , and they &apos;re buying fuel .
i think of new cities like du@@ bai or ancient cities like ro@@ me with za@@ ha ha@@ did &apos;s incredible ma@@ x@@ x@@ i museum , or like right here in new york with the high line , a city which has been so much influ@@ enced by the development of this .
when a new in@@ habit@@ ant moves into the to@@ wer , they already have a roof over their head , so they just typically mark their space with a few cur@@ tains or she@@ ets .
by ni@@ ght@@ fall , the area becomes almost pit@@ ch black , save for a small ligh@@ t@@ bul@@ b or a fire .
when i was let in , it appe@@ ared that this fif@@ th-@@ floor a@@ partment was being trans@@ formed into a complete animal farm , where six or seven co@@ ws stood gra@@ zing in what otherwise would be the living room .
well , ar@@ th@@ ur c . c@@ lar@@ ke , a famous science fi@@ ction writer from the 195@@ 0s , said that , &quot; we over@@ esti@@ mate technology in the short term , and we under@@ esti@@ mate it in the long term . &quot;
it increas@@ ed their cap@@ abilities .
it &apos;s going to come bring it over here and put it down .
he didn &apos;t have to sele@@ ct that from a men@@ u .
that &apos;s climate change and demo@@ graphi@@ cs .
it &apos;s about a little boy whose father was a history bu@@ ff and who used to take him by the hand to visit the ru@@ ins of an ancient me@@ tro@@ poli@@ s on the out@@ sk@@ ir@@ ts of their camp .
as you see here , we had to develop a special ri@@ g to bring the scan@@ ner up close and personal .
we do have the technology that &apos;s sc@@ ale@@ able , and our network of global part@@ ners has been exp@@ anding and can be exp@@ and@@ ed at a ra@@ pid rate , so we &apos;re comfortable that this task can be ac@@ compli@@ shed .
i &apos;d like to thank the wi@@ z@@ ards here .
why no hear@@ ings , no den@@ un@@ ci@@ ations , no people getting ar@@ re@@ sted in front of the r@@ wand@@ an em@@ bas@@ sy or in front of the white house ? what &apos;s the deal ?
it &apos;s got all the u@@ ps and the dow@@ ns of movements .
why is what has been achie@@ ved , or what the movement has done , been necessary but not suff@@ i@@ cient to the crime ?
now , who was ser@@ gi@@ o ? ser@@ gi@@ o vi@@ ei@@ ra de m@@ ell@@ o was his name .
he was the first person to negoti@@ ate with the k@@ h@@ mer rou@@ ge .
maybe you stay re@@ tic@@ ent . maybe you try to char@@ m president bush -- and that &apos;s what he did . and in so doing he ear@@ ned himself , unfortunately , his final and tra@@ gic ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment to iraq -- the one that resul@@ ted in his death .
and in le@@ ban@@ on , southern le@@ ban@@ on in &apos; 8@@ 2 , he said to himself and to everybody else , i will never use the word &quot; un@@ accep@@ table &quot; again .
let &apos;s not h@@ yp@@ e the threat ; let &apos;s actually see it clearly .
because one c@@ up of food a day changes fab@@ ian &apos;s life completely .
but it never stru@@ ck me as it did that moment , because on that image was a woman trying to nur@@ se her baby , and she had no milk to nur@@ se .
and we can see brain vol@@ um@@ es up to 40 percent less in these children .
we did this with food technologi@@ sts in india and pakistan -- really about three of them .
we know this .
well this picture -- i was in he@@ br@@ on in a small shop , this shop , where instead of bringing in food , we provide digital food , a card .
and this zero hunger program costs .@@ 5 percent of gdp and has li@@ f@@ ted many millions of people out of hunger and poverty .
jo@@ se@@ tte she@@ er@@ an , the head of the u@@ n &apos;s world food program , talks about why , in a world with enough food for everyone , people still go hun@@ gry , still die of star@@ vation , still use food as a wea@@ pon of war . her vision : &quot; food is one issue that cannot be solved person by person . we have to stand together . &quot;
you know , the previous talk all@@ u@@ ded to pre@@ vent@@ ing heart disease .
it makes no sense , if you think about it .
so , there you see , it &apos;s a li@@ ver with col@@ on cancer in it , and you see into the micro@@ scope a ly@@ mp@@ h no@@ de where cancer has inv@@ aded .
and it came back at 9@@ 8@@ .@@ 7 , i would say , &quot; great . &quot;
reduce oc@@ curr@@ ence of cancer by a drug that doesn &apos;t even touch the cancer .
so , this picture , although it is beautiful , is a 4@@ 0-@@ gi@@ gab@@ y@@ te picture of the whole prote@@ ome .
what &apos;s interesting is they did it in south america and canada , where it &apos;s &quot; more eth@@ ical to give plac@@ e@@ bo@@ s . &quot;
dan@@ ny and i got 16 million dollars , they announ@@ ced yesterday , to try to atta@@ ch this problem .
there are four major ways sound is affec@@ ting you all the time , and i &apos;d like to raise them in your consciousness today .
and i have a ti@@ p for you . if you have to work in spaces like that , carry head@@ phones with you , with a so@@ o@@ thing sound like bir@@ d@@ song .
music is very powerful . and unfortunately it &apos;s ven@@ e@@ ering commercial spaces , often in@@ appropri@@ ately .
if we all do that we move to a state that i like to think will be sound living in the world .
we also learned that many of the issues facing the people of northern africa affected young people the most .
the stories we were hearing got us to the south pole .
health to the ocean means health for us .
no ocean , no life support system .
what about the water ? &quot;
we &apos;re putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other tr@@ ash into the sea .
but business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral re@@ ef@@ s -- and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
they flas@@ h , and spar@@ kle , and glo@@ w with their own living light .
le@@ gen@@ dar@@ y ocean resear@@ cher syl@@ via ear@@ le shares aston@@ ishing images of the ocean -- and sho@@ cking stat@@ s about its ra@@ pid dec@@ line -- as she makes her prize wish : that we will join her in prote@@ cting the vi@@ tal blue heart of the planet .
they have two types of flight muscle : so@@ -@@ called power muscle , which is stre@@ t@@ ch-@@ activ@@ ated , which means that it activ@@ ates itself and does not need to be controlled on a contra@@ c@@ tion@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ contra@@ ction basis by the nervous system .
so let &apos;s sort of think about this . i think we have to compare -- — we have to compare the size of the brain with what the brain can do .
so here &apos;s some other organisms at the similar scale .
you can te@@ ther a fly to a little stick .
michael di@@ ck@@ in@@ son : how a fly flies
they are conf@@ used , and you cannot make a decision .
and it has not stopped its evolutionary path .
how many trees does it have ?
so , how could we possibly create a reality that we can even understand each other ?
so where do you go ? you go to ib@@ m , and you get a super@@ computer , because they know how to take 10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ator .
we can do it within 10 years , and if we do succe@@ ed , we will send to ted , in 10 years , a h@@ olog@@ ra@@ m to talk to you . thank you .
look at that central building right in the middle of the picture : that &apos;s the 1@@ 3@@ 0-@@ foot diam@@ e@@ ter library , that is exactly the size of the base of the spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p .
it &apos;s quite dangerous , but i believe it &apos;s better to have dangerous things in the open than think you &apos;re going to keep them secret .
and now we have ground ha@@ z@@ ard as@@ s@@ ess@@ ments when you have a blo@@ w-@@ up on the pad .
so that &apos;s the state we &apos;re at : it &apos;s not very good .
and it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .
here is another one -- this is one of my favorite illu@@ sions .
it &apos;s from a paper by john@@ son and gold@@ stein .
the countries on the left have a form at the d@@ m@@ v that looks something like this .
it &apos;s not because it &apos;s tri@@ vi@@ al . it &apos;s not because we don &apos;t care .
the other group of the physi@@ cians , they said , &quot; yesterday when you re@@ vie@@ wed the case you discovered there were two medi@@ cations you didn &apos;t try out yet , i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and pi@@ ro@@ xic@@ am . &quot;
now in some ways , given that you can have ro@@ me with coffee , why would you possibly want ro@@ me without coffee ?
and the least popular became the most popular .
what is the general point ?
and wir@@ eless communic@@ ations has become a u@@ tili@@ ty like electricity and water .
and light is part of the electro@@ magnetic spectrum .
yes .
and not only inte@@ gra@@ te a photo dete@@ ctor here , but maybe use the camera inside .
you would agree with me , hopefully , there &apos;s no issue of capacity anymore .
this is a remote oper@@ ated vehicle bene@@ ath the ocean .
then we go along and create the internet and connect the world together ; we fl@@ atten the world .
and you would , you know , when you think about it , four letters , or the repres@@ entation of four things , makes us work .
a lot of very hand@@ some and pretty people here , sk@@ inn@@ y , ch@@ u@@ bby , different ra@@ ces , cultures . we are all 9@@ 9@@ .@@ 9 % gene@@ tically equal .
you can find out where your rela@@ tives come from ; you can do your gene@@ al@@ og@@ y going back thousands of years .
we can build a better v@@ ine .
there are thousands of micro@@ bes there .
thank you .
i mean , it is really very , very sc@@ ary the ab@@ use that dogs get .
i could speak to you and say , &quot; la@@ y@@ ta@@ y-@@ cha@@ i , pa@@ is@@ ey , pa@@ is@@ ey . &quot;
the dog can s@@ ni@@ ff your bu@@ tt , if you like , when he wants to .
and there &apos;s times , for example , if my son &apos;s friends leave the door open , the dogs have to know you don &apos;t step across this line .
she never raised her voice .
and the se@@ min@@ al moment was , i was getting on a plane in d@@ all@@ as , and in row two was a father , i pres@@ u@@ me , and a young boy about five , ki@@ cking the back of the chair .
when you watch people inter@@ acting with animals or other people , there is very little feedback , it &apos;s too in@@ frequ@@ ent .
how on earth about raising children ?
and i tried , and i made it .
w@@ k : yeah .
when i wake up in the morning i po@@ ur the coffee i read the paper and then i slowly and so soft@@ ly do the dis@@ hes so feed the fis@@ hes you sing me happy birth@@ day like it &apos;s gon@@ na be your last day here on earth all right .
i &apos;m sorry if i put that idea in your head .
and in the end , quite often , the ur@@ ge is stron@@ ger than they are and they bl@@ ur@@ t it out : &quot; if i give you my date of birth , can you tell me what day of the week i was born on ? &quot;
four is blue .
well if 100 , if we think of 100 as being like a square , 75 would look like this .
and po@@ ets , like other artists , play with those intui@@ tive under@@ stand@@ ings .
li@@ fes@@ pan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime .
it &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
you can have , as it were , as@@ ex@@ ual culture .
you find a she@@ ep . you kill it . you get the fat out of it .
lou@@ is xi@@ v had a lot of people working for him .
it isn &apos;t always quite that simple , but there &apos;s a distin@@ ction between speci@@ alized ro@@ les for males and fe@@ males .
trade is 10 times as old as far@@ ming .
but who knows how to make a computer mouse ?
awful things will happen in this century , i &apos;m absolutely sure .
and if you could actually st@@ ack up that many cu@@ ps in real life , that &apos;s the size it would be .
and every single day since then , 1,@@ 100 americans have died .
and the reason that i do this , it &apos;s because i have this fear that we aren &apos;t feeling enough as a culture right now .
how can we turn our cu@@ mu@@ la@@ tive knowledge of vi@@ ro@@ log@@ y into a simple , hand@@ -@@ held , single diagno@@ stic as@@ say ?
so , what we &apos;re doing is just prin@@ ting dna on glass -- little flat things -- and these are going to be mark@@ ers for pa@@ tho@@ gens .
polio and r@@ hin@@ o : they &apos;re in the same family , very close to each other .
so , let &apos;s start off with the positive control first , where we know the person was healthy .
now we &apos;re using this chip . and what are we using it for ?
you do an open lung bi@@ op@@ sy when you &apos;ve got no other op@@ tions .
what is that ? it &apos;s an an@@ tivi@@ ral defen@@ se enzy@@ me .
but now it &apos;s a door .
and you know , if we &apos;re going to get this country out of its current energy situation , we can &apos;t just conser@@ ve our way out ; we &apos;re going to do it the ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned american way , we &apos;re going to inv@@ ent our way out , working together .
and just a few short years following their discovery , al@@ umin@@ um changed from a pre@@ cious metal co@@ sting as much as sil@@ ver to a common struc@@ tural material .
the electr@@ ons go to work in the real world out here , power@@ ing our devices .
i call it the ho@@ ck@@ ey pu@@ ck .
sc@@ aling : conven@@ tional wisdom says reduce cost by producing many .
so ro@@ v@@ s aren &apos;t new .
that &apos;s the only way that we could have done this .
and since they discovered those things , it really stuck with them so much more , and also they would experience their own fail@@ ures ; there was a fail@@ u@@ re-@@ based aspe@@ ct to learning there . it was very important .
now once we mate , we click on the eg@@ g .
i &apos;d start dealing with tri@@ bes , cities and civili@@ zations of them over time .
there &apos;s actually a little read out down there of our planet@@ ary atmosphere , pressure and temperature .
now what i really wanted to do is to present this , basically as wonder@@ fully 3d as it is actually is .
i see you .
i &apos;m a social psych@@ ologist . i study pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , and i teach at a competi@@ tive business school , so it was ine@@ vi@@ table that i would become interested in power dynam@@ ics .
you have other people who are virtu@@ ally collap@@ sing when they come in . as soon they come in , you see it .
so there are a lot of differences . they take more risks .
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s the whole experiment .
they &apos;re being jud@@ ged also , and the jud@@ ges are trained to give no non@@ verb@@ al feedback , so they look like this . like , imagine this is the person intervie@@ wing you .
so i &apos;m taken out of college , i keep trying to go back .
you know ? and she gave the best com@@ ment ever , and people turned around and they were like , oh my god , i didn &apos;t even notice her sitting there , you know ?
it &apos;s all right .
well , it may already have occur@@ red to you that islam means &quot; sur@@ ren@@ der , &quot; or &quot; sub@@ mission of self-@@ interest to the will of al@@ la@@ h . &quot;
it &apos;s not ma@@ xi@@ mi@@ zing the number of grand@@ children we have .
that &apos;s what richard said , back in &apos; 9@@ 3 .
and there were lots of wi@@ dows and or@@ ph@@ ans , people like that , who needed a fo@@ ster home .
these me@@ mes are spre@@ ading around the world and they are wi@@ ping out whole cultures .
that will encourage the spread of relatively ben@@ ig@@ n mu@@ tations of the most tox@@ ic var@@ ie@@ ties .
you become a figure of fun . there &apos;s no trust anymore , only ridi@@ cule .
we then thought we &apos;d make a movie of &quot; car@@ men , &quot; which we recor@@ ded and shot outside on location in the to@@ w@@ n@@ ship outside cape town called k@@ ha@@ ye@@ li@@ t@@ sh@@ a .
well ladies and gentle@@ men , there &apos;s a ti@@ me@@ -@@ hon@@ ored system , which com@@ pos@@ ers have been using for hundreds of years , which pro@@ ves actually that it does .
audience : t , e , d .
no one &apos;s listening . no one &apos;s tru@@ sting .
and you &apos;ll see the orche@@ str@@ a in a kind of su@@ llen revol@@ t .
and at the same time , certainly in r@@ wand@@ a , it destro@@ yed the local re@@ ta@@ iling industry .
but before i do this -- and this is another one of my pet pe@@ ev@@ es -- i want to talk a little bit about who the poor are .
a couple of years later , i meet them .
so the production side is working .
and so i ur@@ ge all of you to think next time as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity that we all have -- to make poverty history -- by really becoming part of the process and moving away from an us-@@ and-@@ them world , and reali@@ zing that it &apos;s about all of us , and the kind of world that we , together , want to live in and share .
somehow , what we need to do is step back from those situations , like that wise old woman , look at the situation through fresh eyes and come up with an 18@@ th cam@@ el .
well what i learned is whenever temper@@ s rise in those communities , someone goes and hi@@ des the po@@ ison ar@@ ro@@ ws out in the bush , and then everyone si@@ ts around in a circle like this , and they sit , and they talk , and they talk .
and my mind started ra@@ cing , &quot; pu@@ er@@ to ri@@ co ? what do i know about pu@@ er@@ to ri@@ co ? &quot;
they give meaning to our lives .
it &apos;s taking an inno@@ cent stran@@ ger and tre@@ ating them as a friend whom you wel@@ come into your home in order to so@@ w and create understanding , or respect , or love .
and then a few years ago , a group of us , about 25 of us from about 10 different countries , decided to see if we could re@@ tra@@ ce the foot@@ steps of abra@@ ham , going from his ini@@ tial birth@@ place in the city of ur@@ f@@ a in southern tur@@ key , northern mes@@ o@@ po@@ tam@@ ia .
the media love it ; they really ad@@ ore it .
let me just show you one thing .
one is , the secret to peace is the third side .
he got a medical doctor .
i think it &apos;s fair to say , most people here could have had a sho@@ wer this morning .
not well designed , not beautiful , not elegan@@ t -- just that they function .
and if you &apos;ve lived in australia in the last 30 years , the final cause -- you will have heard always that indi@@ gen@@ ous people tr@@ ash houses .
we te@@ sted and we re@@ duced the d@@ ust .
later we found the leading cause of illness and death in this particular region is through res@@ pir@@ atory failure .
none of those are limited by geogra@@ ph@@ y , by skin color or by religion . none of them .
well , my biggest ta@@ ke@@ away is that for decades , we &apos;ve been focused on political cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness , but what matters more is emotional cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness .
because you can &apos;t get anyone to agree with you if they don &apos;t even listen to you first .
the reali@@ ties of my community are simple . they look like this .
and my kids , from the poor@@ est con@@ gressi@@ onal distri@@ ct in america , became the first to inst@@ all a green wall , designed by a computer , with re@@ al-@@ live learning tools , 21 stories up -- if you &apos;re going to go visit it , it &apos;s on top of the john han@@ co@@ ck building .
and this is the true tri@@ ple bottom line , because we can take neighbor@@ ho@@ ods that were ab@@ and@@ oned and dest@@ it@@ ute and turn them into something like this with inter@@ i@@ ors like this .
i thought this concept of designing a strong and healthy new york made sense , especially when the resources were free .
and again , bro@@ ok park fe@@ e@@ ds hundreds of people without a food stam@@ p or a finger@@ print .
and in his day , a million dollar gar@@ dens and incredible instal@@ lations .
martin lu@@ ther king said that people need to be u@@ pli@@ f@@ ted with dig@@ nity .
join me . use -- i &apos;ve got a lot of energy . help me use it .
a means to deter@@ mine if there &apos;s a complete block@@ age of a cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ ter@@ y .
it &apos;s implan@@ ted with very conven@@ tional techniques .
and that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not africa -- that &apos;s the typical treatment in the advanced world today .
that means that the magnetic pul@@ se is gener@@ ating an electric current that &apos;s inter@@ fer@@ ing with the er@@ r@@ one@@ ous electrical activity in the brain .
well , &quot; respon@@ sive electrical stimu@@ lation &quot; means that we sense , at a place in your brain which is called an &quot; epi@@ le@@ p@@ tic focus , &quot; which is where the epi@@ le@@ p@@ tic sei@@ z@@ ure begins -- we sense there , that it &apos;s going to happen , and then we respond by appl@@ ying an electrical energy at that spot , which er@@ ases the er@@ rant signal so that you don &apos;t get the clinical mani@@ fe@@ sta@@ tions of the mi@@ gra@@ ine hea@@ da@@ che .
and some of the spon@@ sor@@ s of this ted meeting are such organizations .
as a starting point for discussion with the ted group , a major part of the problem is the nature of the written ex@@ tent of in@@ formed con@@ sent that the patient or spo@@ use must read and sign .
we got repor@@ ts like this .
and what we &apos;re actually really concerned with is this first three hours .
it &apos;s ine@@ vi@@ table , terrible , but really what i want to talk about is , i &apos;m just fascin@@ ated by the leg@@ acy people leave when they die .
i hear you and i know that you would want me to be strong , but right now , i am being su@@ cked down , surro@@ unded and suff@@ oc@@ ated by these ra@@ ging emotional wat@@ ers , cra@@ ving to cle@@ an@@ se my sou@@ l , trying to emer@@ ge on a fir@@ m foot@@ ing one more time , to keep on fighting and fl@@ our@@ ishing just as you taught me .
and i &apos;m going to call these people below the bar@@ rier shu@@ t-@@ ou@@ ts , because they &apos;re really shu@@ t out of the process of being able to share their knowledge with the world .
a lot of teachers are using this stuff . ok , what about ri@@ pping ?
how much would it cost in a boo@@ k@@ store ?
it lets you inter@@ connect ideas indic@@ ating how fields rel@@ ate to each other , and i &apos;ll just give you my personal story .
how many people have heard of creative common@@ s ?
conne@@ xi@@ ons and open content is all about sharing knowledge .
so with those as the principles -- some of you may know se@@ y@@ m@@ our pa@@ per@@ t ; this is back in 198@@ 2 , when we were working in sen@@ egal .
it &apos;s a non@@ profit associ@@ ation ; it raised about 20 million dollars to do the engineering to just get this built , and then have it produced after@@ wards .
now we have none of those , ok ?
the du@@ al mode display -- the idea is to have a display that both works out@@ do@@ ors -- isn &apos;t it fun using your cell phone out@@ do@@ ors in the sun@@ light ?
the games butt@@ ons are missing , but it &apos;ll also be a games machine , book machine .
we &apos;re coming in probably at 1@@ 35 , to start , then dri@@ ft down .
are we dre@@ aming ? is this real ? it actually is real .
they &apos;re cli@@ cking on things and star@@ ing at scre@@ ens . &quot;
i thought i was very clever .
and that in@@ c@@ ites a sort of pan@@ ic architecture -- &quot; oh no , where &apos;s this thing ? &quot;
and so this is the important point that i like to study : that things are beautiful , that it &apos;s still a human connection -- it &apos;s just done in a different way .
but you go to r@@ wand@@ a -- a very small country -- 8@@ ,000 mothers with hiv who are preg@@ nant .
the truth is sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa has 24 percent of the global disease bur@@ den and yet only three percent of the world &apos;s health care workers .
take the same mother , and the nur@@ se , after she gives her her test , takes her to a room .
now , doctors and nur@@ ses -- they too get trained .
and if we can change enough communities , we can change national at@@ ti@@ tu@@ des .
even as we have more tests and more drugs , we can &apos;t reach people ; we don &apos;t have enough provi@@ ders .
and so in re@@ defin@@ ing the health care teams by bringing the ment@@ or mothers in , we can do that .
and we also use func@@ tional m@@ ri , called f@@ m@@ ri , to take a video , a movie , of brain activity when partici@@ pants are taking part in some kind of task like thinking or feeling or percei@@ ving something .
so imagine that you &apos;re the partici@@ p@@ ant in one of our experiments . you come into the lab , you see this compu@@ teri@@ zed task .
and actually , the answer is probably not . there are lots of descri@@ p@@ tions of ad@@ oles@@ c@@ ence in history that sound very similar to the descri@@ p@@ tions we use today .
here &apos;s the go@@ -@@ k@@ art that we built together .
now , this was a project , an engineering project , and we published some pa@@ pers on the design , the system design of it , but we also thought of it as an art instal@@ lation .
so he loved the concept , and when the tel@@ e-@@ actor walked on@@ stage , she walked right up to him , and she gave him a big k@@ is@@ s right on the li@@ ps .
we started working with pie@@ ter and his students , and we asked a surge@@ on to per@@ form a task , and what we do is we , with the robot , so what we &apos;re doing is asking the robot , the surge@@ on to per@@ form the task , and we record the mo@@ tions of the robot .
and now i get to teach her how things work , and we get to build projects together , and i wonder what kind of lessons that she &apos;ll learn from them .
he was bringing peace to a divi@@ ded and violent south africa , one man with an un@@ belie@@ vable sense of his humanity .
the only acc@@ us@@ ation i ever heard le@@ vel@@ ed at him was when one of our cli@@ ents said , &quot; sol@@ ly , you are path@@ ologi@@ cally hel@@ p@@ ful . &quot;
i notice a sli@@ ck of blood in the water around me that gets wash@@ ed down@@ stream .
u@@ bun@@ tu as@@ ks us to open our he@@ arts and to share , and what sol@@ ly taught me that day is the essen@@ ce of this value , his anima@@ ted , em@@ pa@@ thetic action in every moment .
and it occur@@ red to me that the rest of the her@@ d was in fact looking after this young eleph@@ ant .
about 75 years ago , my grand@@ father , a young man , walked into a tent that was conver@@ ted into a movie theater like that , and he fell hop@@ el@@ ess@@ ly in love with the woman he saw on the sil@@ ver screen : none other than ma@@ e west , the hear@@ t@@ thro@@ b of the &apos; 3@@ 0s , and he could never forget her .
you know , a carto@@ on that was meant to be a carto@@ on of the week ended up sta@@ ying so much longer .
and i &apos;ve been very suppor@@ tive until this picture shows up on my facebook page .
i actually went and sat in on her class . she started by giving students primary source docum@@ ents from india , pakistan , from britain , and i said , &quot; wow . &quot; then she asked them to separate fact from bi@@ as .
you might have a 5@@ -@@ year plan , but what about a 200@@ -@@ year plan ? artist ra@@ g@@ ha@@ va k@@ k has set his eyes on an ultra@@ -@@ long-term hori@@ zon ; at tedx@@ sum@@ mit , he shows how it helps gui@@ de today &apos;s choices and tomorrow &apos;s goals -- and encoura@@ ges you to make your own 200@@ -@@ year plan too .
they do this because they &apos;ve stri@@ pped the soil from all nutri@@ ents from growing the same cro@@ p over and over again .
not too long ago , my un@@ cle said that he off@@ ered my si@@ x-@@ year-old cou@@ sin cer@@ e@@ al .
and we developed techniques to di@@ ve inside and under the ic@@ e@@ berg , such as he@@ ating pa@@ ds on our kid@@ ne@@ ys with a battery that we dra@@ g@@ ged around , so that , as the blood flo@@ wed through our kid@@ ne@@ ys , it would get a little boo@@ st of war@@ m@@ th before going back into our bodies .
so that &apos;s when i first learned of the is@@ lands and had no idea what i was getting into .
and we explor@@ ed the surface of the is@@ lands as well -- very important bird ne@@ sting site , some of the most important bir@@ d-@@ ne@@ sting sites in the pacific , in the world .
we as a world are fac@@ ed with a problem .
so i asked the minister over dinner , i said , &quot; would you consider a situation where you would still get paid -- we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is -- but you leave fish and the sharks and the sh@@ ri@@ mp in the water ? &quot;
the ocean he@@ ated up as it does sometimes , and the hot spot formed and st@@ all@@ ed right over the pho@@ en@@ i@@ x is@@ lands for six months .
and that insu@@ red that we could move this forward and it would have both the self-@@ interest of ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i as well as the self-@@ interest of the world .
when you graph the number of potential employees versus the number of jobs in the country , you see the gap gets bigger and bigger over time , and then , during the great rec@@ ession , it opened up in a huge way .
i had the chance a little while back to ride in the google autonom@@ ous car , which is as cool as it sounds .
and they did this by infin@@ itely multi@@ pl@@ ying the power of our mus@@ cles , over@@ coming the limit@@ ations of our mus@@ cles .
so as i look around at all the evidence , and i think about the room that we have ahead of us , i become a huge digital opti@@ m@@ ist , and i start to think that this wonderful stat@@ ement from the physi@@ c@@ ist free@@ man dy@@ son is actually not hyper@@ bo@@ le . this is an accu@@ rate as@@ s@@ ess@@ ment of what &apos;s going on .
i know that it &apos;s incredibly bor@@ ing to hear about other people &apos;s happ@@ in@@ esses .
or they had this apple by yo@@ ko on@@ o -- that , of course , later on was , you know , made into the lab@@ el for the be@@ at@@ les .
so this is one .
this one says , &quot; please let me die in peace . &quot;
we fle@@ w to ari@@ zon@@ a -- the designer who works with me , and myself -- and photograph@@ ed this one .
most old people in the u.s. end up living separ@@ ately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate reti@@ re@@ ments homes for the el@@ der@@ ly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other rela@@ tives , and their li@@ fel@@ ong friends .
finally , older people in traditional societies have a huge signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce that would never occu@@ r to us in our modern , liter@@ ate societies , where our sources of information are books and the internet .
changes for the worse begin with the cru@@ el reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past .
they usually love their grand@@ children , and are e@@ ager to spend time with them .
but there are also things to be ad@@ mi@@ red about people in traditional societies , and perhaps to be learned from them .
and you hear the voice of his father , j@@ or@@ -@@ el , saying to earth , &quot; i have sent to you my only son . &quot;
he had told his ad@@ vis@@ ers , &quot; get me all the sch@@ ol@@ ars to trans@@ late any book they can get their hands onto into arab@@ ic , and i will pay them its weight in gold . &quot;
i think that &apos;s there in all cultures , right ?
she said , &quot; that &apos;s not me . &quot;
next thing you knew , there &apos;s a full page co@@ vering us posi@@ tively , janu@@ ary 2@@ 2@@ n@@ d , 2006 , which changed our lives forever , because anybody goo@@ gling islam and carto@@ on or islam and com@@ ic , guess what they got ; they got me .
j@@ ab@@ bar : dan@@ a , i can &apos;t do this without you .
as a psych@@ ologist , i worry for the world in general , but worry about the perception of how people see themselves in my part of the world .
but i bor@@ row a lesson that i learned from him .
it feels like we &apos;re all suffering from information over@@ load or data gl@@ ut .
so there it is : 2@@ 27 billion is what africa ow@@ es .
see this line , this is a landscape for violent video games .
can you guess what this data set is ?
and when i started designing , i discovered an od@@ d thing about myself .
so , you have the eye , and then you drop in the concep@@ ts .
but of course , china has an enormous population .
but what it points to is that visu@@ ali@@ zing information like this is a form of knowledge comp@@ res@@ sion .
but not too un@@ comfortable , because there &apos;s something un@@ thre@@ at@@ ening about seeing a political perspective , versus being told or forced to listen to one .
so what you &apos;re sm@@ elling now is the top note .
once you figure this out , you can really im@@ press people at par@@ ties .
and he puts an exc@@ la@@ ma@@ tion mark , ok ? this is an awful lot of work .
you have a unique smell , a unique vi@@ bra@@ tion .
in other words , no mir@@ r@@ ors , no las@@ ers , no pris@@ ms , no non@@ sense , just a tiny device , and he built this device . and this device uses electr@@ on tun@@ nel@@ ing .
there are some re@@ ck@@ less people , but it &apos;s not worth it , ok ?
lu@@ ca tur@@ in : the science of sc@@ ent
it &apos;s a gri@@ d , it &apos;s a cal@@ end@@ ar .
having spent 18 years as a child of the state in children &apos;s homes and fo@@ ster care , you could say that i &apos;m an exper@@ t on the subject , and in being an exper@@ t , i want to let you know that being an exper@@ t does in no way make you right in light of the truth .
so the ad@@ option pa@@ pers were sig@@ ned .
i tried pra@@ ying . i swe@@ ar i tried pra@@ ying .
when i got to the — for the next four , five years , i was held in four different children &apos;s homes .
in creativity i saw light .
and it &apos;s this journey that is of such interest to humanity , and it &apos;s this journey that has been the focus of the past three generations of my family , as we &apos;ve been in east africa looking for the fossil rema@@ ins of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past .
if you want to become a fossil , you actually need to die somewhere where your b@@ ones will be rapi@@ dly bu@@ ried .
his brothers certainly were able to run long di@@ stances ch@@ as@@ ing pre@@ y , probably swe@@ ating hea@@ vi@@ ly as they did so .
the question now is , well , who are we ?
we all have an african orig@@ in .
no di@@ ce : no do@@ do skelet@@ on for me . but the damage had been done .
and so butt@@ on by butt@@ on , ver@@ te@@ bra@@ e by ver@@ te@@ bra@@ e , i built my way down .
i actually had done some research a few years before -- it &apos;s why the fol@@ der was there .
i ended up with this : my mal@@ t@@ ese fal@@ c@@ on .
there you can see , it &apos;s wei@@ gh@@ ing in at 27 and a half pounds .
and i got up off the seat of my bi@@ ke , and i started pump@@ ing my legs , and as i su@@ cked in the cold mountain air , i could feel it burning my l@@ ung@@ s , and i looked up to see the sun sh@@ ining in my face .
&quot; no . that body is broken . it can no longer serve me . &quot;
and then she said , &quot; jan@@ ine , you &apos;ll have to re@@ think everything you do in your life , because you &apos;re never going to be able to do the things you did before . &quot;
i so@@ ak@@ ed it up and i thought , how could i ever have taken this for gran@@ ted ?
i was worried . i didn &apos;t know how i &apos;d re@@ act to being next to her .
they said , &quot; you know , when do you want to come out ? &quot;
and he said , &quot; well , you take the contro@@ ls , and you fly towards that mountain . &quot;
and mom and dad ? never been up .
i &apos;m not interested at all in blo@@ bis@@ m or any of that super@@ ficial ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h that you see coming out as design .
at that point , i don &apos;t know if that &apos;s possible at all .
this is the fre@@ ak@@ y side coming out .
not a bad idea . i don &apos;t know . i need to talk to jan@@ ine and a few other people about that , but i believe instin@@ c@@ tively that that mer@@ ing@@ ue can become something , a car -- i don &apos;t know .
wow . let &apos;s go for it . that &apos;s the kind of stuff .
it goes with the flow of the poly@@ mer and you &apos;ll see -- there &apos;s an image coming up right now that shows the full thing .
i said , &quot; well you don &apos;t copy apple , that &apos;s for sure . &quot;
it &apos;s a city car . you drive along . you get out .
this is a shot in the studio .
it &apos;s self-@@ inspi@@ rational again . i mean , the rare times when i &apos;m there , i do enjoy it . and i get lots of kids coming -- lots and lots of kids coming .
so , it &apos;s going to end .
so you turn on the camera , turn out the lights .
another thing all these molecules are telling us that , appar@@ ently , bi@@ ol@@ umines@@ c@@ ence has evolved at least 40 times , maybe as many as 50 separate times in evolutionary history , which is a clear indic@@ ation of how spec@@ tac@@ ularly important this tra@@ it is for survival .
so , she &apos;s got a l@@ ure that she sti@@ cks out in front of this living mou@@ se@@ tra@@ p of need@@ le-@@ shar@@ p teeth in order to attra@@ ct in some uns@@ us@@ pe@@ cting pre@@ y .
for this fish , it &apos;s actually whole cells with nu@@ cle@@ i and mem@@ bran@@ es .
made an intensi@@ fied camera , wanted to make this electr@@ onic j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish .
and based on this , i went back to the national science foundation and said , &quot; this is what we will discover . &quot;
they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; eight o &apos;@@ clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , i can get a game of ten@@ nis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot;
and then this happened .
that &apos;s a good thing , so i accep@@ ted the prize .
this is in mon@@ tan@@ a , 2008 .
and i thought , in the beginning -- i studied this bird for a couple of years -- that , well , shouldn &apos;t the brain of this bird be dama@@ ged ?
so i &apos;ve been hearing color all the time for eight years , since 2004 , so i find it completely normal now to hear color all the time .
and also , some ra@@ ch@@ man@@ in@@ o@@ v piano con@@ cer@@ to@@ s as main dis@@ hes , and some b@@ j@@ or@@ k or ma@@ don@@ na des@@ ser@@ ts , that would be a very exciting restaurant where you can actually eat son@@ gs .
and i like to exhi@@ bit these paint@@ ings in the exhi@@ bi@@ tion hall@@ s without lab@@ els , and then i ask people , &quot; which one do you pre@@ fer ? &quot;
if you run a business , it &apos;s hard to do much of anything without calling your general coun@@ sel .
it &apos;s really changed our lives in ways that are sort of im@@ per@@ cep@@ ti@@ ble ; and yet , when you pull back , you see it all the time .
of course , this is u@@ top@@ ia ; it &apos;s a for@@ mul@@ a for paraly@@ sis , not freedom .
again , studies have shown it &apos;s directly at@@ tribu@@ table to the rise of due process .
i grew up in the south and wh@@ iled away the su@@ mm@@ ers fishing .
t@@ wea@@ king the law &apos;s clearly not good enough , and t@@ ort re@@ form , which is a great idea , lo@@ wers your cost if you &apos;re a busin@@ es@@ sper@@ son , but it &apos;s like a band@@ -@@ aid on this g@@ ap@@ ing wo@@ und of di@@ str@@ ust .
worked pretty well for 200 years .
it &apos;s not true . auth@@ ority , in fact , is essential to freedom .
they don &apos;t have the time to get to know us .
it is nai@@ ve beyond descri@@ ption to think that having blo@@ cked this source of financial collap@@ se , you have blo@@ cked all possible sources of financial collap@@ se .
and most important , a wise person does this impro@@ vis@@ ing and ru@@ le-@@ ben@@ ding in the service of the right a@@ im@@ s .
and so she impro@@ vis@@ ed a sentence -- 11 months , and not only that , but rele@@ ase every day to go to work .
third , don &apos;t waste your time on kids who moved into the distri@@ ct too late for their sc@@ or@@ es to be coun@@ ted .
psych@@ ologists have known this for decades , and it &apos;s time for poli@@ cy@@ makers to start paying attention and listen to psych@@ ologists a little bit , instead of econom@@ ists .
in the ve@@ ter@@ ans &apos; cour@@ t -- this was the first of its kind in the united states .
even gold@@ man sa@@ chs once used to serve cli@@ ents , before it turned into an institution that ser@@ ves only itself .
does not require hero@@ ic acts of self-@@ sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce on the part of prac@@ ti@@ tion@@ ers .
it was characteri@@ zed by a nation@@ -@@ ver@@ sus@@ -@@ nation , very fra@@ gi@@ le stan@@ do@@ ff .
now , the bom@@ b shel@@ ters at that point -- let &apos;s say you bought a pre@@ fa@@ b one -- it would be a few hundred dollars , maybe up to 500 , if you got a fan@@ cy one .
chap@@ ter two starts in 199@@ 1 .
and there &apos;s a lot of contro@@ ver@@ sy about whether ter@@ ror organizations have the know@@ -@@ how to actually make a nuclear wea@@ pon .
this is alex@@ ander le@@ bed , who was a general that worked with yel@@ ts@@ in , who talked about , and pres@@ ented to con@@ gress , this idea that the russi@@ ans had developed -- these su@@ it@@ case bom@@ bs . they were very low y@@ i@@ el@@ d -- 0@@ .@@ 1 to one kil@@ ot@@ on , hi@@ ro@@ shi@@ ma was around 13 kil@@ ot@@ ons -- but enough to do an un@@ belie@@ vable amount of damage .
and if you &apos;re in the hal@@ f-@@ mile radi@@ us of where this bom@@ b went off , you have a 90 percent chance of not making it .
they are paraly@@ zed .
now , this is my favorite civil defen@@ se slide , and i -- -- i don &apos;t want to be inde@@ lic@@ ate , but this -- he &apos;s no longer in office . we don &apos;t really care , ok .
and ri@@ ghtly so , in many cases .
we can make progress . we can show benefits .
the question then is , how do we ta@@ p into this ?
re@@ duc@@ ing pollution is expensive , therefore businesses don &apos;t want to do it .
in the very short run , you can sometimes fo@@ ol yourself into thinking that there &apos;s fundament@@ ally op@@ pos@@ ing goals , but in the long run , ultimately , we &apos;re learning in field after field that this is simply not true .
but we also have to recognize business is not going to do this as effectively as if we have n@@ gos and government working in partner@@ ship with business .
i can cut any way i want to , so i cut right here .
but fortunately , our digital man has &quot; un@@ do . &quot;
so this is an@@ at@@ o@@ ma@@ ge table . thank you .
much of this revolution can be tra@@ ced to four men who met at cambridge university in 18@@ 12 : charles bab@@ b@@ age , john her@@ sch@@ el , richard j@@ ones and willi@@ am whe@@ well .
the philosop@@ hi@@ cal break@@ fast club changed that , working together .
the british associ@@ ation would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to ad@@ mit women as full members .
and i can see their point , because i started my career as a theore@@ tical nuclear physi@@ c@@ ist .
it gro@@ ws up into the adult stage like that and then goes through a benjam@@ in butt@@ on phase , and actually goes back@@ wards and back@@ wards until it &apos;s like a little em@@ br@@ yo again , and then actually gro@@ ws back up , and back down and back up -- sort of yo@@ -@@ yo -- and it never dies .
so i &apos;m high@@ ligh@@ ting just a few words and saying defini@@ tions like that rely on things that are not based on am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids or leaves or anything that we are used to , but in fact on processes only .
that &apos;s charles off@@ ri@@ a on the left , ti@@ tus brown on the right .
because if we can , maybe we have a chance of actually disco@@ vering life somewhere else without being bi@@ ased by things like am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids . &quot;
and here &apos;s the result .
i can tell you indeed it is , because this type of spectrum , just like what you &apos;ve seen in books , and just like what you &apos;ve seen in am@@ in@@ o ac@@ ids , it doesn &apos;t really matter how you change the environment , it &apos;s very rob@@ ust ; it &apos;s going to refle@@ ct the environment .
and that in a sense re@@ moves us again , like all of our scientific disco@@ ver@@ ies , or many of them -- it &apos;s this continu@@ ous de@@ thr@@ oning of man -- of how we think we &apos;re special because we &apos;re alive .
we don &apos;t know -- and this is really amazing to me -- we don &apos;t know how many children were born , or how many children there are in bo@@ li@@ via or bot@@ s@@ wan@@ a or b@@ hu@@ tan .
i can tell you , i often wasn &apos;t really paying attention .
and when i saw the pal@@ m pilot for the first time , i thought , why can &apos;t we put the forms on these pal@@ m pil@@ ots and go out into the field just carrying one pal@@ m pilot , which can hold the capacity of tens of thousands of paper forms ? why don &apos;t we try to do that ?
and this is a problem for which we need to scale this technology and we need to scale it now .
so we created software called mag@@ p@@ i , which has an online form cre@@ ator .
that &apos;s less than i used to get just travel@@ ing out for two weeks to do a consu@@ l@@ tation .
how do we ste@@ er a ballo@@ on ?
this is very practical .
and then he asked me -- and this is something i will never forget in my life -- he just asked me , &quot; you &apos;re the good pilot up there .
we land@@ ed with 40 kil@@ os .
if we want to show the potential , we have to fly day and night .
this is the complete structure of the airplane .
so , through spee@@ ches like this one today , through intervie@@ ws , through meetings , our goal is to get as many people possible on the team .
you can , it turns out , be in two places at once .
band aid , live aid .
si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half thousand afri@@ cans dying every single day from aids -- a pre@@ vent@@ able , treat@@ able disease -- for lack of drugs we can get in any pharma@@ cy .
because there is no way we can look at what &apos;s happening in africa , and if we &apos;re honest , conclu@@ de that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else .
&quot; the war against ter@@ ror is bo@@ und up in the war against poverty . &quot;
more anti-@@ retro@@ vir@@ als make sense .
ideas that you gest@@ ated in your you@@ th .
last year at data , this organization i helped set up , we launched a campaign to su@@ mm@@ on this spirit in the fight against aids and extreme poverty .
that &apos;s really what i would like you to do .
you see , if this is true , and i believe it is , that the digital world you all created has un@@ cou@@ pl@@ ed the creative imagination from the physical con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts of matter , this should be a piece of p@@ is@@ s .
that &apos;s one billion media hits .
one , by one , by one .
thank you very much once again .
so , how do we make and understand metaph@@ ors ?
third step is cognitive dis@@ son@@ ance .
they may feel confi@@ dent , say , in taking out mor@@ t@@ g@@ ages they really can &apos;t afford .
but there is a better trans@@ lation .
and expression also , it has brought tal@@ ents .
and i was privi@@ le@@ ged because i was born into a family , my father would always encourage the boys and the girls .
and we have a more gen@@ der@@ -@@ bal@@ an@@ ced new@@ s@@ room today .
because i didn &apos;t believe a journalist can be a journalist with -- how can you talk to people if you have your face covered ? -- and so on ; it &apos;s just a movement .
and i just wanted to share with you : there &apos;s one repor@@ ter that came .
it &apos;s natural .
th@@ ank@@ fully , i met re@@ da gir@@ g@@ is , who is dry as to@@ ast , but he and his team at john@@ s hop@@ kins didn &apos;t just want me to survive , they wanted me to live a meaning@@ ful life .
literally hundreds of el@@ ev@@ ator ri@@ des were spent with me alone stu@@ ff@@ ing the pu@@ mp into my span@@ x , hop@@ ing the do@@ ors wouldn &apos;t open un@@ expec@@ ted@@ ly .
i was dying , and if i didn &apos;t mix that stuff up fast , i would never leave that a@@ partment alive .
but the next morning , while i was still in the hospital , i got a tele@@ phone call .
and if you want an example of per@@ sever@@ ance , gr@@ it and strength in a beautiful , little pac@@ ka@@ ge , it is her .
pen@@ el@@ op@@ e ja@@ ges@@ s@@ ar ch@@ aff@@ er : i was going to ask if there &apos;s a doctor in the house .
in fact , my invol@@ vement in the whole pe@@ sti@@ cide issue was sort of a surprise as well when i was approach@@ ed by the largest chemical company in the world and they asked me if i would ev@@ al@@ u@@ ate how at@@ ra@@ zine affected am@@ phi@@ bi@@ ans , or my fro@@ gs .
p so speaking of est@@ ro@@ gen , one of the other com@@ pounds that ty@@ r@@ one talks about in the film is something called bis@@ phen@@ ol a , b@@ pa , which has been in the news recently .
the evidence of that is that studies in rat@@ s , again with at@@ ra@@ zine , show that the hor@@ m@@ one im@@ balance at@@ ra@@ zine gener@@ ates causes abor@@ tion .
p it &apos;s a very profound notion to know that we as women are at the van@@ gu@@ ard of this .
now if i told the men in this village that the fro@@ gs have po@@ ur imm@@ une function and eg@@ gs developing in their te@@ stes , the connection between environmental health and public health would be clear .
plastic is not pu@@ ri@@ fied by the re-@@ mel@@ ting process like glass and metal .
the re@@ tain@@ er r@@ ings for the cap@@ s also have consequences for a@@ qua@@ tic animals .
the recor@@ d-@@ hol@@ der , only two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half in@@ ches long , had 8@@ 4 pieces in its tiny sto@@ mach .
that &apos;s 3@@ 8 stories t@@ all .
to us , when we look at a red@@ wood tree , it seems to be mo@@ tion@@ less and still , and yet red@@ wo@@ ods are constantly in motion , moving up@@ ward into space , artic@@ ul@@ ating themselves and fil@@ ling red@@ wood space over red@@ wood time , over thousands of years .
all other pri@@ mates , when they &apos;re sc@@ ared , they run up a tree , where they feel safe .
and then the trees tend to fl@@ are out into plat@@ form@@ -@@ like areas at the top .
these are mil@@ len@@ ni@@ al structures -- por@@ tions of the tree that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old .
it made a trans@@ -@@ species jump out of some other organis@@ m in asia , where it was living on he@@ m@@ lock trees in asia .
so , you have to wonder when , you know , if some other species than us was recor@@ ding the stories that ma@@ tter@@ ed on earth , you know , our stories are about iraq and war and politics and cele@@ bri@@ ty go@@ ssi@@ p .
all right .
so there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
and that &apos;s the last 20 minutes of mal@@ ware every single day .
these guys were running an operation called i@@ .@@ m@@ .@@ u@@ . , a cyber@@ crime operation through which they ne@@ tt@@ ed millions .
and that code has been en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted , so let &apos;s dec@@ r@@ y@@ pt it .
now that &apos;s a nice car for a 20@@ -@@ something year-old kid in st . pe@@ ter@@ s@@ bur@@ g .
because everything around us is being run by these .
mik@@ ko h@@ yp@@ po@@ nen : fighting viruses , defen@@ ding the net
a lot of people are worried about what is ration@@ ality about ?
that &apos;s a complicated problem ; that &apos;s a lot to know .
and how much cl@@ out could they bring to bear if they cho@@ se to engage on the issue ?
i &apos;ve taken in@@ puts on posi@@ tions and so forth , run it through a computer model that had simul@@ ated the dynam@@ ics of interaction , and these are the simul@@ ated dynam@@ ics , the predic@@ tions about the path of policy .
these folks are the mon@@ e@@ yed interests in iran , the bank@@ ers , the oil people , the ba@@ za@@ aries .
so it would be a good thing .
and that &apos;s over 20 hours of video every minute .
the video &apos;s inspired over 2@@ 6@@ ,000 dollars in don@@ ations to end dom@@ esti@@ c violence .
mar@@ gar@@ et g@@ ould ste@@ wart , youtube &apos;s head of user experience , talks about how the u@@ bi@@ qu@@ it@@ ous video site works with copy@@ right hol@@ ders and cre@@ ators to fo@@ ster a creative ecosystem where everybody w@@ ins .
we will not be there .
the pal@@ u also had an un@@ can@@ ny ability to for@@ ec@@ ast weather conditions days in ad@@ v@@ ance .
and i realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way .
or are you running the same pattern ? because i believe that the invisible force of intern@@ al drive , activ@@ ated , is the most important thing in the world .
that &apos;s &quot; how do you take the invisible and make it visible , &quot; right ?
somebody who &apos;s working for you , you know , or a partner , or even yourself . when you fail to achieve a goal , what &apos;s the reason people say they fail to achieve ?
but i appreci@@ ated the energy , i &apos;ll tell you that .
what shapes you ? two invisible forces . very quickly . one : state .
everyone needs certain@@ ty that they can avoid pain and at least be comfortable . now , how do you get it ?
now , you can get signi@@ fi@@ can@@ ce a million ways , but to be significant , you &apos;ve got to be unique and different .
second -- but this is what changed my life , this is what sha@@ ped me as a human being -- &quot; somebody &apos;s gift .
how many of you know somebody who no matter what happens fin@@ ds a way to get p@@ is@@ sed off ? how many know somebody like this ?
je@@ wish man with family in the occu@@ pi@@ ed terri@@ tory , someone in new york who would have died if he was at work that day , and this man who wanted to be a terror@@ ist and made it very clear .
thomas dol@@ by : &quot; love is a lo@@ aded pi@@ sto@@ l &quot;
then , knowing the geogra@@ phi@@ cal location and the time , we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence .
&quot; i feel like i &apos;m in this fo@@ g of depression that i can &apos;t get out of . &quot;
here are gender , age , weather , location .
another techni@@ que is directly questi@@ oning people .
ze@@ us bat@@ t@@ ling chron@@ os for control of mo@@ unt oly@@ m@@ pus .
it &apos;s using the ap@@ i of a really great company that i work with in new york , actually , called da@@ y@@ life .
you can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source . this one &apos;s from al ja@@ ze@@ era .
they get a bad ra@@ p .
let &apos;s say you &apos;re in love . all right ?
those are common clou@@ ds .
it &apos;s to be re@@ min@@ ded that we are creatures that in@@ hab@@ it this ocean of air .
and this is our be@@ ast of bur@@ den -- this is a computer tom@@ ograph@@ y machine , a ct machine .
so what we do is that we put all these sli@@ ces together .
that machine is , today , about as fast as my iphone .
now at this point , i would also like to em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze that , with the greatest respect for the people that i &apos;m now going to show -- i &apos;m going to show you a few cases of virtual au@@ top@@ si@@ es -- so it &apos;s with great respect for the people that have died under violent circum@@ stances that i &apos;m showing these pictures to you .
so it really , really helps the crimin@@ al investig@@ ation to establi@@ sh the cause of death , and in some cases also direc@@ ting the investig@@ ation in the right direction to find out who the kil@@ ler really was .
so when i virtu@@ ally touch data , it will generate forces in the pen , so i get a feedback .
so what we &apos;re really getting out of this is information of the structure of the brain , but we can also measure the difference in magnetic properties of blood that &apos;s oxy@@ gen@@ ated and blood that &apos;s de@@ ple@@ ted of oxygen .
so this is really , really nice , and i think this is a great tool .
my mot@@ to is always , i only hi@@ re people that are smar@@ ter than i am and most of these are smar@@ ter than i am .
i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible , to try to connect the acade@@ mic stuff with the real world .
so it &apos;s not the final story , but it &apos;s an incredibly powerful sum@@ mary of everything we know about nature at the most basic level .
i won &apos;t go into the details of why we think the universe is like this , but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know .
as i pur@@ su@@ ed my career , something was always g@@ na@@ wing away inside me .
and in 2001 , i took a research leave to visit them .
and so when word came out that a@@ im@@ s was opening , it spread very quickly via e-@@ mail and our website .
when a coun@@ ty is col@@ ored yellow , we &apos;ve received an app@@ lic@@ ation ; orange , we &apos;ve accep@@ ted an app@@ lic@@ ation ; and green , a student has gradu@@ ated .
and after a@@ im@@ s , she@@ h@@ u wanted to do high-@@ energy physics , and he came to cambridge .
we want to roll out 15 a@@ im@@ s centers in the next five years , all over africa .
accep@@ ting his 2008 prize , physi@@ c@@ ist nei@@ l tu@@ ro@@ k spea@@ ks out for tal@@ ented young afri@@ cans star@@ ved of opportunity : by un@@ lo@@ cking and nur@@ turing the continent &apos;s creative potential , we can create a change in africa &apos;s future .
r@@ ory is a graduate student at stanford .
and nobody was listening then , but now people are beginning to listen because there &apos;s a pres@@ sing , technologi@@ cal problem that we face .
this is what in@@ tel does to keep ad@@ ding more cor@@ es onto the chip .
instead of doing this in software , or doing those kinds of algorith@@ ms , we went and talked to neuro@@ bi@@ ologists who have actually rever@@ se engine@@ ered that piece of brain that &apos;s called the re@@ tin@@ a .
let me just end by saying that this is what happens when you put africa in a piano , ok .
and second , it gives us the opportunity to understand how these super@@ massive black holes interact with their environment , and to understand how they affect the forma@@ tion and evolution of the galaxies which they resi@@ de in .
and it turns out that it &apos;s actually pretty simple to figure out .
and there is a very nice spi@@ ral up in the upp@@ er left .
and this is a wide field picture taken of the center of the mil@@ ky way .
but it &apos;s relatively challen@@ ging for astronom@@ ers who want to look through the atmosphere to astronom@@ ical sources .
and this one , this one goes around in a human lifetime .
you should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole .
we do this by sho@@ ot@@ ing a las@@ er up into the atmosphere , and what we think we can do is if we sh@@ ine a few more that we can cor@@ rect the rest .
now ted enter@@ ed this real@@ m every day by impro@@ vis@@ ing in a sort of tin pan alle@@ y style like this .
now over the cent@@ u@@ ries it grew into the big pieces we always think of , like con@@ cer@@ to@@ s and sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , but even the most ambi@@ ti@@ ous ma@@ ster@@ piece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fra@@ gi@@ le and personal moment -- like this one from the bee@@ tho@@ ven vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ to .
well not@@ ation not only passed the music on , not@@ ating and en@@ co@@ ding the music changed its pri@@ ori@@ ties entirely , because it en@@ ab@@ led the musi@@ cians to imagine music on a much va@@ ster scale .
but what &apos;s the actual difference between these two ch@@ or@@ ds ?
it &apos;s the pas@@ sing on part . it &apos;s the &apos; why &apos; part of it .
i never know who might be there , who might be absor@@ bing it and what will happen to it in their life .
in 18@@ 27 , a fellow called george po@@ co@@ ck actually pi@@ one@@ ered the use of kit@@ es for to@@ wing bu@@ g@@ gi@@ es in ra@@ ces against horse car@@ ri@@ ages across the english coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
and this is where we &apos;re actually going .
like the speak@@ er before me , i am -- that &apos;s the ted virg@@ in , i guess -- i &apos;m also the first time here , and i don &apos;t know what to say .
and then , when the piece takes some@@ what of a soli@@ fied form -- soli@@ di@@ fied , exc@@ use me -- soli@@ di@@ fied form , you &apos;re supposed to actually poli@@ sh the piece , poli@@ sh the details , and then poli@@ sh the over@@ all performance of the com@@ position .
oh , d and f -- too familiar .
this kid is known online as li@@ l dem@@ on .
and the first thing you need is ... a crowd , a group of people who share a common interest .
and even if it &apos;s not that el@@ o@@ qu@@ ent -- and it &apos;s not -- it can still really make your day .
i mean , it &apos;s really not news for me to tell you that innovation emer@@ ges out of groups .
but looking at video cli@@ ps po@@ sted by stran@@ gers , a world of possibility op@@ ens up for him .
incredibly , all of this can be communic@@ ated on just a few square in@@ ches of a screen .
and so , as we &apos;ve thought about this , you know , it &apos;s become clear to us what the next stage of ted &apos;s evolution has to be .
i want to introduce you to a good friend of ted who just happens to live in africa &apos;s biggest sh@@ ant@@ y@@ town .
ted &apos;s chris ander@@ son says the rise of web video is driving a worldwide phenomenon he calls crowd acceler@@ ated innovation -- a self-@@ fu@@ el@@ ing cycle of learning that could be as significant as the invention of print . but to ta@@ p into its power , organizations will need to embra@@ ce radical open@@ ness . and for it means the da@@ wn of a whole new chap@@ ter ...
first of all , i must , as a speak@@ er , provide a service to the audience and talk about what i will give you , instead of saying what i can &apos;t have .
now i hope you enjoy the s@@ ession .
valu@@ ation is just what you think it is , you know ?
here &apos;s another couple .
you have to stand up in the moment to do that .
there &apos;s another hu@@ b in london , now , and the rest are getting set up . we hope to give the data away at some stage . that &apos;s a complicated issue about making it available to the rest of the world .
that &apos;s the argument i want to make ton@@ ight .
suddenly , all sorts of transport , travel information were possible , and this gave birth to , what i like to call , the bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tic age .
in this country , if we win the ele@@ ction , we are going to make all government spending over 2@@ 5,000 pounds transparent and available online , se@@ arch@@ able for anyone to see .
the best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill is to show them their own spending , to show them what their neighb@@ ors are spending , and then show what an energy conscious neighb@@ or is spending .
sorry , shar@@ on . here you go .
the u.s. is ti@@ ed for 15@@ th in reading , but we &apos;re 2@@ 3@@ rd in science and 3@@ 1@@ st in math .
i want to show you what this video compon@@ ent of met looks like in action .
i &apos;ll see you later .
reading and writing dna code is getting easier and che@@ aper .
there &apos;s one probably going to open up in mo@@ s@@ co@@ w , one in south korea , and the cool thing is they each have their own individual fla@@ vor that grew out of the community they came out of .
i sig@@ ned up for something called the personal genome project .
some people ask me , well , why am i involved ?
and yet , a couple of weeks later , he was picked up and taken to prison where he was subje@@ cted to a medical ex@@ am , including a ful@@ l-@@ body search in full view of the others in the cell .
and in many parts of the world that inclu@@ des women and children who are especially vulnerable .
and this is exactly what happened to hel@@ ma and don@@ go from nam@@ i@@ bia .
and the money , the money we need for the global response to hiv , that is s@@ hr@@ in@@ king .
now coming up with a v@@ acc@@ ine for hiv or a cure for aids -- now that &apos;s ro@@ cket science .
there is an epidemic of hiv , and with it an epidemic of bad laws -- laws that effectively crimin@@ alize being hiv positive . at the tedx@@ sum@@ mit in do@@ ha , fellow s@@ her@@ e@@ en el-@@ fe@@ ki gives a for@@ ce@@ ful argument that these laws , based in stig@@ ma , are actually helping the disease spread .
imagine that .
so provide most of what most people want within that 20@@ -@@ minute walk .
so what &apos;s interesting is , then if you begin to add new things to it , like autonom@@ y , you get out of the car , you park at your dest@@ ination , you p@@ at it on the bu@@ tt , it goes and it par@@ ks itself , it char@@ ges itself , and you can get something like seven times as many vehi@@ cles in a given area as conven@@ tional cars , and we think this is the future . actually we could do this today .
that means twice as much par@@ king , though .
thank you .
this is ke@@ em bay up in a@@ chil@@ l island .
&quot; li@@ ab@@ han mor , &quot; suggest@@ ing a big animal .
so we concent@@ r@@ ated main@@ ly in north don@@ egal and west ker@@ ry as the two areas where i was main@@ ly active .
christ@@ mas day it was out on the shel@@ f edge .
so les no@@ ble in ab@@ er@@ de@@ en kind of found this a bit un@@ belie@@ vable really .
there &apos;s only 8@@ ,000 bas@@ king shar@@ k fe@@ males in the world ?
and we would use conven@@ tional metho@@ ds -- i have a cro@@ ss@@ bo@@ w , you see the cro@@ ss@@ bo@@ w in my hand there , which we use to sam@@ ple wh@@ ales and dolph@@ ins for genetic studies as well .
and you r@@ ar@@ ely see them .
you want to learn as much as you can .
this was what many call immer@@ sion journ@@ alism , or under@@ cover journ@@ alism .
for the first time , i fil@@ med on hidden camera the guys who do this , and they were ready to buy the arm and they were ready to use it to pre@@ p@@ are those po@@ tions for people .
and here was him , den@@ ying .
and that has ai@@ ded in me putting a lot of people behind b@@ ars .
an@@ as are@@ me@@ y@@ a@@ w an@@ as : how i named , sh@@ am@@ ed and ja@@ iled
i was shi@@ el@@ ded from the pa@@ ins of bi@@ got@@ ry and the social re@@ stri@@ ctions of a religi@@ ous@@ l@@ y-@@ based up@@ bringing .
if my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagno@@ sed me as something like gender dy@@ s@@ mor@@ phic and put me on hor@@ mon@@ es to sta@@ ve off pu@@ ber@@ ty .
how could they say that we as a group were not deser@@ ving of equal rights as somebody else ?
there is no equ@@ ality in the united states .
but here &apos;s what i was starting to learn that was really interesting : self evi@@ dent tru@@ ths doesn &apos;t er@@ ase the differences between us .
asi@@ de from the fact that we play with one legal hand ti@@ ed behind our bac@@ ks , and once you get past the shared narra@@ tive of pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
the only question is , what was in the ju@@ ice ?
immediately the bush admini@@ stration military said ... what ?
that pris@@ on@@ er covered himself with sh@@ it every day , and they used to have to roll him in di@@ rt so he wouldn &apos;t st@@ ink .
what does the situation bring out of them ?
the lear@@ ner could be midd@@ le-@@ a@@ ged , could be as young as 20 .
so mil@@ gra@@ m is quanti@@ fying evil as the will@@ ing@@ ness of people to blin@@ dly o@@ be@@ y auth@@ ority , to go all the way to 4@@ 50 vol@@ ts .
it was a real co@@ p car , it was a real poli@@ ce@@ man , and there were real neighb@@ ors in the street , who didn &apos;t know that this was an experiment .
in many , soldiers are anony@@ mous in uni@@ form .
and he goes on to say , &quot; the land@@ mark stanford study provi@@ des a cau@@ tion@@ ary tale for all military oper@@ ations . &quot;
and our kids &apos; hero@@ es are also wrong models for them , because they have super@@ natural tal@@ ents .
and i want to end with the story that some of you know , about wes@@ ley au@@ tre@@ y , new york sub@@ way hero .
let &apos;s op@@ pose the power of evil systems at home and ab@@ road , and let &apos;s focus on the positive .
so all of those col@@ ored lines cor@@ respond to bun@@ ches of ax@@ ons , the fi@@ bers that join cell bodies to sy@@ nap@@ ses .
so imagine a gri@@ d , like the one i &apos;m showing you right now , and now imagine , within that gri@@ d , that two-@@ dimensional she@@ et , imagine neurons .
and something else that happens is that those ima@@ ge-@@ making regi@@ ons where you have the pl@@ ot@@ ting of all these neu@@ ral maps , can then provide signals to this ocean of pur@@ ple that you see around , which is the associ@@ ation cortex , where you can make recor@@ ds of what went on in those is@@ lands of ima@@ ge-@@ making .
so that &apos;s one more element for this continu@@ ity .
look at &quot; cer@@ e@@ bra@@ l cortex , &quot; look at &quot; brain stem , &quot; look at &quot; body , &quot; and you get the picture of the inter@@ connec@@ tivity in which you have the brain stem provi@@ ding the gro@@ unding for the self in a very ti@@ ght inter@@ connection with the body .
it is developed in the cultures .
we actually just got &quot; middle class &quot; in col@@ or@@ a@@ do spr@@ ings , col@@ or@@ a@@ do , but you get the picture .
anyone heard of these two guys as an example ?
we don &apos;t want one face .
i wrote the book i needed to read .
the activi@@ sts i intervie@@ wed had nothing in common , literally , except for one thing , which was that they all c@@ ited their mothers as their most lo@@ om@@ ing and important activ@@ ist influ@@ ences .
under the del@@ u@@ ge of min@@ u@@ te@@ -@@ to-@@ minute text conver@@ sa@@ tions , ema@@ ils , rel@@ ent@@ less exchange of media chan@@ n@@ els and pas@@ s@@ words and app@@ s and re@@ min@@ ders and t@@ wee@@ ts and ta@@ gs , we lose sight of what all this f@@ uss is supposed to be about in the first place : ourselves .
that blue line there is my bra@@ in@@ wave .
and then we were asked to do something really big for the olymp@@ ics .
in the original zen bo@@ und game , you play it by sc@@ roll@@ ing your fing@@ ers over the pad .
bra@@ in@@ wave technology can understand us , anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ te our emotions and find the best solutions for our needs .
my mom &apos;s an artist , and as a child i &apos;d often see her bring things to life with the stro@@ ke of a br@@ ush .
and i took that driving lesson , and i said , &quot; i &apos;m going to learn how to drive . &quot;
and they decided to tell me that i could see .
and tempor@@ arily , very un@@ expec@@ ted@@ ly , they dro@@ pped .
i had no idea who i was anymore .
and i went home , and , because the pain in my ch@@ est ach@@ ed so much , i thought , &quot; i &apos;ll go out for a run . &quot;
do something different . what do you want to be ? &quot;
but you know , i was belie@@ ving in the wrong thing .
and so here i am .
if you stand and st@@ are out of the window on your own with a ci@@ gar@@ ette , you &apos;re a fu@@ cking philosop@@ her .
it &apos;s an interesting question .
and what that means is that in looking at solutions , we &apos;ve probably given too much pri@@ ority to what i call technical engineering solutions , new@@ ton@@ ian solutions , and not nearly enough to the psych@@ ological ones .
the kore@@ ans , very assi@@ du@@ ously , did test both .
one of the great mista@@ kes , i think , of economics is it fa@@ ils to understand that what something is , whether it &apos;s reti@@ re@@ ment , un@@ emplo@@ y@@ ment , cost , is a function , not only of its amount , but also its meaning .
they believed that there was a discipl@@ ine called pra@@ x@@ e@@ ology , which is a pri@@ or discipl@@ ine to the study of economics .
if that seems like some strange , ab@@ str@@ use thing , in the u.k. , the post office had a 9@@ 8 percent success rate at deli@@ vering fir@@ st-@@ class mail the next day .
so if you do something that &apos;s per@@ cep@@ tu@@ ally bad in one respect , you can damage the other .
all materials are available for use .
people will do lots and lots and lots of different studies , and the occasi@@ ons when it works they will publi@@ sh , and the ones where it doesn &apos;t work they won &apos;t .
now you might say , well , that &apos;s an extremely unusual example , and i wouldn &apos;t want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of the same kind of cher@@ r@@ y-@@ pi@@ cking and sel@@ ec@@ tive refer@@ en@@ cing that i &apos;m acc@@ using other people of .
and when that responsibility is diff@@ used between a whole network of researchers , acade@@ mi@@ cs , industry spon@@ sor@@ s , journ@@ al edi@@ tors , for some reason we find it more accep@@ table , but the effect on patients is dam@@ ning .

coming back quickly , we see here the radio sphere that we jum@@ ped out of in the beginning , but these are posi@@ tions , the lat@@ est posi@@ tions of ex@@ op@@ lan@@ ets that we &apos;ve ma@@ pped , and our sun here , obviously , with our own solar system .
thank you .
and music is very fun , but it &apos;s also transforma@@ tive .
so hyper@@ sc@@ ore lets you start from scrat@@ ch very quickly .
this pre@@ mier@@ es in mon@@ ac@@ o -- it &apos;s in september 2009 . if by any chance you can &apos;t make it , another idea with this project -- here &apos;s this guy building his leg@@ acy through this very unusual form , through music and through the environment .
we went with the type of gest@@ ure metaphor that dan was already used to with his speaking controll@@ er .
but instead of making it very liter@@ al , showing you exactly the camera tra@@ cing , we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic movement , and shows the way it &apos;s being analy@@ zed .
i want to hear that song . un@@ tie me . &quot;
so why do we need commit@@ ment devices ?
i mean , you can &apos;t burn it ; that &apos;s illegal .
so i &apos;ve been working for about a decade now on finding other ways to change people &apos;s relationship to the future self without using commit@@ ment devices .
being up at the top means that you &apos;re enjo@@ ying a high income in reti@@ re@@ ment .
so what we do is we take pictures of people -- in this case , colle@@ ge-@@ age people -- and we use software to age them and show these people what they &apos;ll look like when they &apos;re 60 , 70 , 80 years old .
it &apos;s not telling you which way to put the sli@@ der , it &apos;s just re@@ min@@ ding you that you are connected to and leg@@ ally ti@@ ed to this future self .
this inclu@@ des the little system in arab@@ ic called al-@@ je@@ br@@ a .
and i thought that was worth sharing .
in the sorts of countries i work in , that so@@ -@@ called treatment gap approach@@ es an aston@@ ishing 90 percent .
now , if i had to draw together all these different experiments in task shif@@ ting , and there have of course been many other examples , and try and identify what are the key lessons we can learn that makes for a successful task shif@@ ting operation , i have co@@ ined this particular ac@@ r@@ ony@@ m , s@@ und@@ ar .
a project called te@@ e@@ b was started in 2007 , and it was launched by a group of environment mini@@ sters of the g@@ 8 + 5 .
that can &apos;t keep going on , because economic in@@ centi@@ ves and dis@@ in@@ centi@@ ves are very powerful .
because these are important benefits for the poor .
and if you see the benefits of the man@@ gro@@ ve in terms of the stor@@ m protection and cy@@ cl@@ one protection that you get and in terms of the fis@@ her@@ ies , the fish nur@@ series , that provide fish for the poor , that answer is more like $ 1@@ 1,000 .
calcul@@ ating this at the national level is one thing , and it has be@@ gun .
today we can &apos;t yet do that , but i think the path is la@@ id out .
but the thing is to do a lot more of that .
he was , of course , fore@@ most , a very , very , very great scientist .
but when he didn &apos;t win , when he lost , he would lau@@ gh and seem to have just as much fun as if he had won .
well , what do you talk about when you talk about minds ?
and di@@ ck became convinced at some point that he and i had some kind of simil@@ ar@@ ity of person@@ ality .
i apo@@ logi@@ ze for the sex@@ ist conversation here , but this is the way it really happened .
i &apos;ll tell you what that theory was soon enough .
in 196@@ 8 , in my own university -- i wasn &apos;t there at the time -- but in 196@@ 8 , they were explor@@ ing the structure of the pro@@ ton .
you don &apos;t have to worry about the forces between them .
we really needed to do some ar@@ che@@ ology in the tra@@ il@@ er itself to figure out what &apos;s authenti@@ c in an air@@ stream tra@@ il@@ er , and what feels like it has true purpose and u@@ tili@@ ty .
and so in this tra@@ il@@ er i took it upon myself to think about travel , and es@@ cape , in an i@@ dio@@ syn@@ cra@@ tic sense .
and i do put power tools into the hands of secon@@ d-@@ gra@@ ders .
you don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to learn from playing with it .
there is a world of interesting things inside your dis@@ h@@ was@@ her .
and it &apos;s fun for the whole family .
i &apos;m not ready for jo@@ int re@@ plac@@ ement . &quot;
so in that case , i have to design -- and we designed with ur@@ i gal@@ il@@ i and tom tu@@ re@@ k -- an enzy@@ me was@@ h to was@@ h away , or stri@@ p , those gal@@ ac@@ to@@ sy@@ l ep@@ it@@ op@@ es with a specific enzy@@ me .
thank you very much .
we are living at the age here at the end of the book , where electr@@ onic paper will und@@ ou@@ b@@ ted@@ ly replace it .
you can see exactly how many of these types of it@@ em@@ s would fit in a room .
and they &apos;re connected pri@@ mar@@ ily because of this here .
and it was the har@@ dest invention i ever made , but it got me started , and i got really lucky after that .
what if i could a@@ im sound the way i a@@ im light ?
now , they &apos;ve tried this a couple years ago and it failed , because the che@@ cker gets ti@@ red of hearing the same message every 20 minutes , and reach@@ es out , turns off the sound .
it changes with temperature and with bar@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ c pressure .
we &apos;ve got the military -- have just de@@ plo@@ yed some of these into iraq , where you can put fa@@ ke tro@@ op movements quar@@ ter of a mile away on a h@@ ill@@ side .
i actually dre@@ w that up on a little cru@@ m@@ my ma@@ c computer in my at@@ tic at my house , and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design i dre@@ w way back when .
six years ago , after 20 years in graphic design and ty@@ po@@ graph@@ y , i changed the way i was working and the way most graphic designers work to pur@@ sue a more personal approach to my work , with only the hum@@ ble attemp@@ t to simply make a living doing something that i loved .
so here &apos;s the word puzz@@ le again .
the world is full of wonder .
and those who didn &apos;t respond will never recei@@ ve anything from me ever again .
i do spend a lot of time on my work .
this little fellow was developed by a group of 10 under@@ graduate students at the autonom@@ ous systems laboratory at eth@@ -@@ zur@@ ich .
in the next mode , we can get re@@ zero to follow a person .
and a lot of people might use structures like ab@@ alone sh@@ ells , like ch@@ al@@ k .
before that , they were all soft , flu@@ ff@@ y structures .
and i was really fortun@@ ate to have president obama visit my lab this year on his visit to mit , and i really wanted to give him a peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table .
and so the other thing that &apos;s beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te structures with nice link sc@@ ales .
the last example are solar cells .
you &apos;ll find out that people don &apos;t say what businesses think they would say .
you look back on your day , and you &apos;re like , i got nothing done today .
and if you &apos;re inter@@ rup@@ ted while you &apos;re going through the early ones -- if someone bu@@ mp@@ s you in bed , or if there &apos;s a sound , or whatever happens -- you don &apos;t just pick up where you left off .
you decide when you want to be di@@ stra@@ cted by the tv .
show me what &apos;s up , &quot; and this sort of thing and they keep inter@@ rup@@ ting you at the wrong time , while you &apos;re actually trying to do something they &apos;re paying you to do , they tend to inter@@ ru@@ pt you .
you don &apos;t sche@@ du@@ le an ei@@ ght-@@ hour meeting with out@@ look .
it &apos;s better than a new monit@@ or . it &apos;s better than new software , or whatever people typically use .
and i hope that some of these ideas were at least pro@@ vo@@ ca@@ tive enough for mana@@ gers and bo@@ s@@ ses and business ow@@ ners and organi@@ z@@ ers and people who are in charge of other people to think about la@@ ying off a little bit and giving people some more time to get some work done .
so i &apos;ve probably done about five years &apos; research looking at what people carry .
and this is fairly univer@@ s@@ ally appreci@@ ated , it turns out , which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected .
ok , now , that sounds like something you get on a chinese fortun@@ e coo@@ k@@ ie , right ?
i &apos;m in kam@@ pal@@ a and i &apos;m the wa@@ ge ear@@ ner .
this is a kind of ha@@ cker &apos;s man@@ ual , and it &apos;s written in chinese and english .
your notion of identity is out@@ -@@ of-@@ date already , ok , for those extra three billion people .
and if we &apos;re smart , we &apos;ll look at this stuff that &apos;s going on , and we &apos;ll figure out a way to en@@ able it to in@@ form and inf@@ use both what we design and how we design .
or , this one , coming to us from india .
another is to change our lifest@@ y@@ les .
half of guys who smo@@ ke are im@@ po@@ tent .
and then i went home that night , and i had an even larger emotional mel@@ t@@ down , which i &apos;ll say more about in a minute .
and second of all , it requires imagination .
the rema@@ ining regre@@ ts per@@ tain to these things : fin@@ ance , family issues un@@ related to roman@@ ce or par@@ enting , health , friends , spiritu@@ ality and community .
we can &apos;t identify with that part .
and for those of us who are control fre@@ a@@ ks and perfe@@ c@@ tion@@ ists -- and i know where of i speak -- this is really hard , because we want to do everything ourselves and we want to do it right .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case though .
but it turns out , it doesn &apos;t re@@ mind me of the thing i thought it would ; it re@@ minds me constantly of something else instead .
all easier said than done .
if you bought them in vast bul@@ ks , you could get them at a little under 400 dollars .
for those of you who saw &quot; an in@@ conven@@ i@@ ent truth , &quot; the most important slide in the gore lec@@ ture is the last one , which shows here &apos;s where green@@ house g@@ ases are going if we don &apos;t do anything , here &apos;s where they could go .
and they &apos;ve achie@@ ved a lot of other amazing health results .
over 15 percent of the dea@@ ths among adults and children occur@@ red because of inte@@ st@@ in@@ al par@@ as@@ ites and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a from dir@@ ty water and in@@ ade@@ qu@@ ate san@@ it@@ ation -- all entirely pre@@ vent@@ able and treat@@ able .
my wish is that ted as@@ s@@ ist us in our work and help us to build a high-@@ quality rural health system in a poor country , r@@ wand@@ a , that can be a model for africa , and indeed , for any poor country anywhere in the world .
and i decided at that moment that i would spend the rest of my life doing whatever i could to improve their possibilities .
these bub@@ bles are made from natural c@@ ot@@ ton and ru@@ b@@ ber from the ru@@ b@@ ber tree .
so we had some good ideas : we took old automo@@ bile wind@@ shi@@ el@@ ds , put paper behind them and created the first alternative to the whit@@ e@@ board .
and when the kinder@@ garten kids recently moved their gate , they found out the f@@ ence was made out of ta@@ pi@@ o@@ ca .
the kids love it .
it has admini@@ strat@@ ors in it and many , many other things .
it was like brea@@ thing .
and then a third attemp@@ t , which also pat@@ ched me back together pretty well , until it failed .
i felt , and i still feel , a lot of distance from the human main@@ stream .
when i heard it the first time , it sent chil@@ ls down my sp@@ ine .
for almost all the years of life on earth , there was no intelligent life .
and when i told the people in the press room at the acade@@ my a@@ wards that they &apos;d better inst@@ all some phone lines for internet connections , they didn &apos;t know what i was talking about .
now i have no ja@@ w left at all .
so i have not come here to com@@ pla@@ in .
and we should save trees in the end .
it was my personal inti@@ mate chan@@ nel to talk to the re@@ a@@ ders .
same in po@@ land : plus 13 , up to 35 percent raise of circu@@ lation after three years .
you can work for a small company , in a bor@@ ing bran@@ ch .
v@@ us@@ i ma@@ hl@@ as@@ ela : &quot; th@@ ul@@ a mama &quot;
18 months later i wo@@ ke up .
but imagine what it was like for them when i showed up at their do@@ or@@ step ?
so they figured not being able to see is one thing , but they need to get me to talk .
made perfect sense .
when ra@@ mon@@ a pi@@ er@@ son was 22 , she was hit by a dr@@ un@@ k driver and spent 18 months in a com@@ a . in this talk , she tells the remarkable story of her re@@ co@@ very -- drawing on the collective skills and wisdom of a sen@@ ior citizens &apos; home . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
and it uses the efficiency of symme@@ try to be able to pro@@ pag@@ ate itself so well .
seven of them are exactly the same , and the ei@@ gh@@ th one is turned up@@ side down .
what can you do to a symme@@ tri@@ cal object , move it in some way , so it looks the same as before you moved it ?
and for gal@@ o@@ is this was like the zer@@ oth symme@@ try .
so i &apos;ve given names . the capital letters , a , b , c , d , e , f , are the names for the ro@@ tations .
and , using those rules , he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symme@@ tries .
they all look very different . but this language allows us to say that they are repres@@ ent@@ ations of the same symme@@ tri@@ cal abstra@@ ct object , which we call 4@@ -@@ 4@@ -@@ 2 . nothing to do with foot@@ ball , but because of the fact that there are two places where you can ro@@ tate by a quar@@ ter of a turn , and one by half a turn .
okay , now if you want to play , i want you to stand up , okay ?
so g@@ he@@ z , there we go . that &apos;s your new symme@@ tri@@ cal object .
first of all , worse nutri@@ tion , maybe shor@@ ter life sp@@ ans .
we find more and more complex arr@@ ange@@ ments of machines that make it harder and harder to diagno@@ se what &apos;s going on .
it could benefit from trage@@ dies .
there are two histor@@ i@@ ans of business at the university of mar@@ y@@ land , br@@ ent gold@@ far@@ b and david kir@@ sch , who have done some extremely interesting work , much of it still un@@ published , on the history of major innova@@ tions .
and as a result , when we say , &quot; this isn &apos;t brain surgery , &quot; that pa@@ ys tribu@@ te to how difficult it was for anyone to learn from their mista@@ kes in a field of medicine that was considered so dis@@ coura@@ ging in its pro@@ spe@@ cts .
if you want texas , go t , t , and you jump right to that thing without even opening the po@@ p-@@ up men@@ u .
while we &apos;re talking about text , when you want to high@@ light -- this is just an example .
it &apos;s very flat , kind of ri@@ gi@@ d .
so one of the things you can do to our i@@ con@@ s , just like paper , is cre@@ ase them and fold them , just like paper . remember , you know , something for later .
although many people tried to comfort and encourage me , their words so@@ unded like meaning@@ less noise .
so what you see , that pre@@ ci@@ pi@@ ce , that high pre@@ ci@@ pi@@ ce with the valley , is the 2008 financial crisis .
and whenever we saw a flo@@ ck of birds that had electr@@ onic communication , we thought , &apos; probably has something to do with the americans . &apos; &quot; and i said , &quot; yeah .
all of a sudden , nine percent just goes away , and nobody to this day can even agree on what happened because nobody or@@ dered it , nobody asked for it .
they &apos;re using pra@@ g@@ matic chaos now .
these are the ones where you have to press what floor you &apos;re going to go to before you get in the el@@ ev@@ ator .
these guys down on wall street , mar@@ co pol@@ o and cher@@ o@@ ke@@ e nation , they &apos;re eight micro@@ seconds behind all these guys going into the empty buildings being hol@@ lo@@ wed out up around the car@@ rier hotel .
kev@@ in sla@@ v@@ in : how algorith@@ ms shape our world
j@@ s : okay . we@@ t hands .
you will for the rest of your life remember those words every time you pick up a paper to@@ we@@ l .
but the other two are some@@ what questi@@ on@@ able .
well the meaning of y@@ i@@ el@@ d is : you must y@@ i@@ el@@ d the ri@@ ght-@@ of-@@ way .
but before i di@@ ve into those i want to ad@@ mit that i am an opti@@ m@@ ist .
people didn &apos;t know what caused it until the early 19@@ 00@@ s , when a british military man figured out that it was mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
those mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os are not infe@@ cted .
of course we need drug companies to give us their exper@@ ti@@ se .
when i first learned the statistics , i was pretty stun@@ ned at how bad things are .
and so you &apos;d say , &quot; wow , we should reward those people .
and we &apos;ve done almost nothing to study what that is and to draw it in and to replic@@ ate it , to raise the average cap@@ ability -- or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system .
how does that compare to a normal school ?
and i thought it was so fantastic .
i would come home with my clo@@ th@@ es re@@ e@@ king of wo@@ od@@ smo@@ ke .
he had to embra@@ ce this challenge , and i use that word inten@@ tion@@ ally . he didn &apos;t have to over@@ come dy@@ sle@@ xi@@ a .
you know where this story goes .
the first time i told these stories , a man in the audience raised his hand and said , &quot; all these artists talk about their work , not their art , which has got me thinking about my work and where the creativity is there , and i &apos;m not an artist . &quot; he &apos;s right . we all w@@ rest@@ le with experience and challenge , limit@@ s and loss .
i knew i wasn &apos;t ready . i knew i had to qu@@ it . &quot;
see , why not ? we celebra@@ te birth@@ days , where all you have to do is not die for 3@@ 65 days — — and yet we let people who have made our lives better walk around without knowing it .
i &apos;m a surge@@ on , and we surge@@ ons have always had this special relationship with light .
we do our best , based upon our training and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience , we say , you know what , the cancer &apos;s gone .
the molecule they had developed had three parts .
in this movie , you can see that the tumor is green .
that doesn &apos;t mean that there &apos;s cancer inside .
and he brought his whole team with him .
they said , &quot; wow !
and that &apos;s that all the sen@@ sa@@ tions , feelings , decisions and actions are medi@@ ated by the computer in your head called the brain .
and hon@@ est@@ ly , where we &apos;ve gone through over the last 11 years , through an attemp@@ t to find ways of turning circu@@ its and cells and parts and path@@ ways of the brain on and off , both to understand the science and also to con@@ front some of the issues that face us all as humans .
and to do that -- the brain doesn &apos;t feel pain -- you can put -- taking advantage of all the effort that &apos;s gone into the internet and communic@@ ations and so on -- op@@ tical fi@@ bers connected to las@@ ers that you can use to activ@@ ate , in animal models for example , in pre-@@ clinical studies , these neurons and to see what they do .
and then when you sh@@ ine light on the entire network , just that cell type will be activ@@ ated .
this goes back to the pa@@ v@@ lo@@ vi@@ an days .
and they do the opposite thing of the molecule i told you about before with the blue light activ@@ ator chan@@ nel@@ r@@ ho@@ dop@@ sin .
in many forms of blin@@ dness , like re@@ tin@@ i@@ tis pig@@ ment@@ o@@ sa , or ma@@ cular de@@ generation , the phot@@ ore@@ cep@@ tor cells have at@@ rop@@ hi@@ ed or been destro@@ yed .
so this pre-@@ clinical study , i think , bo@@ des hope for the kinds of things we &apos;re hop@@ ing to do in the future .
buildings are col@@ oni@@ zed by air@@ bor@@ ne micro@@ bes that enter through windows and through mechan@@ ical venti@@ lation systems .
and when you &apos;re out@@ do@@ ors , that type of air has micro@@ bes that are common@@ ly associated with plant leaves and with di@@ rt .
and so i started to think , well , you know , den@@ sity , den@@ sity -- i &apos;m not sure if , you know , this was the right call .
so i wanted to talk a little bit about the reasons why that works so well , and how some of those reasons kind of map on to where the web is going right now .
there &apos;s some theore@@ tical physi@@ c@@ ist at mit named steven john@@ son who has dro@@ pped two spo@@ ts , i &apos;m happy to say .
now , what you &apos;re having here is basically a global brain that you &apos;re able to do lots of kind of experiments on to see what it &apos;s thinking .
but what &apos;s interesting is you can then bro@@ aden the search and actually see interesting things and get a sense of what else is out there .
it follo@@ ws a power law , so that there are a few extremely well-@@ lin@@ ked to , popular blogs , and a long tail of blogs with very few links .
evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narra@@ tive form .
it was an education of the most profound and transforma@@ tive kind .
&quot; pi@@ ck@@ po@@ cket &quot; started a debate about crimin@@ ality dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ement .
when the sa@@ il@@ ors mu@@ tin@@ i@@ ed at sea in a demand for human@@ e conditions , it was these teena@@ gers that f@@ ed the cre@@ w .
our members de@@ fy the bin@@ ary descri@@ ption of how we so often describe our young .
that was one sentence .
so , as kev@@ in kel@@ ly poin@@ ted out , there is no end@@ game .
we see the flo@@ ws of materials in a rather terri@@ fying pro@@ spe@@ ct .
and richard mei@@ er , who was one of my teachers , kept coming over to my des@@ k to give me cri@@ tic@@ ism , and he would say , &quot; bill , you &apos;ve got to under@@ stand@@ - -- solar energy has nothing to do with architecture . &quot;
you know , most people don &apos;t realize it comes from the la@@ tin compe@@ tere , which means stri@@ ve together .
we have since dat@@ ab@@ ased the 4@@ 000 most common@@ ly used chemicals in human manufacturing , and we &apos;re rele@@ as@@ ing this dat@@ ab@@ ase into the public in six weeks .
they showed up in five days .
we then take the par@@ ks and lay them out as e@@ col@@ o@@ gical infrastructure .
ed@@ ward s@@ no@@ w@@ den started lea@@ king information , top secret classi@@ fied information , from the u.s. intelligence agen@@ cies , and we started learning about things like pris@@ m and x@@ key@@ sc@@ ore and others .
i love freedom , but even i agree that some sur@@ v@@ ei@@ llan@@ ce is fine .
that &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do , and since most , a very big part of the internet traffic today is en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted , they &apos;re trying to find ways around the en@@ cr@@ yp@@ tion .
they probably have a team building on th@@ ur@@ s@@ day ev@@ ening in a pu@@ b .
it &apos;s the war on ter@@ ror .
it should be built in to all the systems we use .
how do you do that ?
on the side here , this is tem@@ po@@ ral cortex .
and the ner@@ ves themselves are the ones who are recei@@ ving input .
one side note on the colle@@ ction of brains : because of the way that we collect , and because we require con@@ sent , we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains .
so again this is what they can see under the micro@@ scope .
we &apos;ve done right now two human bra@@ in@@ s-@@ worth of data .
in the side effect profi@@ le , etc . , you want to see where those genes are turned on .
and what we &apos;re finding is actually , even at the brain bio@@ chemical level , we are quite similar .
thanks .
afri@@ cans have already got a lot of aid .
and here &apos;s another question : malaria . malaria kill@@ s almost 9@@ 00,000 people every year , most of them in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , most of them under five .
but these three questions , i can answer them .
well , if that &apos;s the problem , then that &apos;s much easier .
now , you might say , &quot; well , but it &apos;s not sustainable .
second thing is , how about the use ?
so why shouldn &apos;t we do the same with social policy ?
but if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars for every child under five who dies , that would be 90 billion per year just for that problem .
it can pro@@ mp@@ t action .
and this is not a r@@ he@@ tor@@ ical question .
and she said , &quot; i want to write a case , eu@@ v@@ in -- a case on a publi@@ c@@ -@@ sector leader that has lessons for the corpo@@ rate world . &quot;
i &apos;m sitting in cambridge , mas@@ sach@@ use@@ tts at the health@@ care development conference .
so let &apos;s start looking at some of those .
same language , ti@@ mel@@ ine , et ce@@ ter@@ a . makes sense .
it &apos;s an important strate@@ gic partner .
they &apos;re going to be ta@@ pping into carbon cre@@ di@@ ts .
there &apos;s an over@@ hang of capital in the u.s. , and the key is y@@ i@@ el@@ d pi@@ ck@@ up .
thank you .
nature &apos;s beauty is a gift that cul@@ tiv@@ ates appreci@@ ation and gra@@ titude .
it &apos;s a gift that millions and millions in the world will never experience .
so now i &apos;m in a par@@ king lot . basically it &apos;s a tin can , and i &apos;m basically re@@ creating the laun@@ ch with fire ex@@ t@@ ingu@@ is@@ her@@ s , fire , i have wa@@ x that i thre@@ w in front of the l@@ ens to look like ice , and so basically if you believed any of the stuff that i just showed you , what you were re@@ acting to , what you &apos;re em@@ ot@@ ing to , is something that &apos;s a total fal@@ se@@ hood , and i found that really kind of fascinating .
he was hop@@ ing it was going to work out okay .
and when jim shot it , it was only one su@@ b , because he was photograph@@ ing from the other , and i don &apos;t remember if i did this or jim did this .
he was the master of his universe , and we wanted hu@@ go to feel the same way , so we created this shot .
ok , swa@@ p them around , put your right hand up .
kb : no , but you &apos;re ok , yes ?
kb : sure there &apos;s not ?
that &apos;s the question .
kb : ok , oh . tell them -- actually here &apos;s the thing , answer it , answer it , answer it .
kb : you did feel that ? what did you feel ?
kb : ok , take a seat . exc@@ ell@@ ent , ok .
ok , just stand , stage forward .
do you remember when they thre@@ w the co@@ ke bot@@ tle out of the airplane , and it land@@ ed on the ground , and it didn &apos;t break ?
i want you to imagine all the negative energy from that broken relationship , from that guy , being im@@ par@@ ted into the broken piece of glass , which will represent him , ok .
ni@@ co@@ le : mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm .
s@@ j : no one in the audience ?
i &apos;ll put the blin@@ d@@ fold on .
kb : ok , tell me when to stop .
thank you .
l@@ ord and lady ri@@ g@@ or mor@@ tis were ni@@ b@@ bling on the tar@@ ma@@ c , and then the gun went off and all the gir@@ lies started running , and all the mu@@ m@@ mi@@ es went , &quot; run ! run ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia ! run ! &quot;
we &apos;ve got the oc@@ ci@@ p@@ ital lo@@ be so we can actually see the world .
but my point is , if we don &apos;t talk about this stuff , and we don &apos;t learn how to deal with our lives , it &apos;s not going to be one in four . it &apos;s going to be four in four who are really , really going to get ill in the up@@ sta@@ irs department .
so oxyto@@ cin is a simple and ancient molecule found only in ma@@ mm@@ als .
so in these countries , more economic trans@@ actions occu@@ r and more wealth is created , alle@@ vi@@ ating poverty .
we found 90 percent of the first decisi@@ on-@@ makers sent money , and of those who received money , 95 percent re@@ turned some of it .
to investig@@ ate this question , we ran an experiment where we had people watch a video of a father and his four year-old son , and his son has ter@@ min@@ al brain cancer .
op@@ ens it up and there &apos;s a pe@@ ar@@ l ne@@ ck@@ l@@ ace inside .
now we know what happens .
so you may be wondering : these are beautiful laboratory experiments , do they really apply to real life ?
many people are t@@ we@@ eting right now .
we have found that people who rele@@ ase more oxyto@@ cin are happ@@ ier .
they engine@@ ered a system that was so rob@@ ust that it &apos;s still with us today , continu@@ ously producing iden@@ tical people for a machine that no longer exists .
the children came running in .
to his left is his student . she &apos;s six .
i &apos;ll go back to the lab and say , we need teachers .
so i asked this girl , &quot; can you help them ? &quot;
but that &apos;s terrible . we are homo sa@@ pi@@ ens .
i know more british grand@@ mothers than anyone in the universe .
i &apos;ve tried this in many , many schools .
so what &apos;s my wish ?
and i said to her , &quot; you know , i want to give a computer to everybody , every child .
it was invented around the 19@@ 20@@ s , and the inv@@ ent@@ or , l@@ é@@ on ther@@ em@@ in -- he also was a musi@@ cian bes@@ i@@ des an inv@@ ent@@ or -- he came up with the idea for making the ther@@ em@@ in , i think , when he was working on some shor@@ t@@ wave radi@@ os .
his land was no longer regi@@ ster@@ ed in his name .
and this dis@@ order is in direct contr@@ ast to the un@@ alter@@ able order of a b@@ loo@@ d@@ line .
in@@ stances of pro@@ min@@ ent social and political fig@@ ures in poly@@ gam@@ ous relationships has led to the perception of poly@@ gam@@ y as a symbol of wealth , status and power .
during the time i was in bo@@ s@@ nia , the mor@@ tal rema@@ ins of zu@@ m@@ ra &apos;s el@@ dest son were ex@@ hum@@ ed from a mass gra@@ ve .
in the foot@@ note pan@@ el that ac@@ companies this work i photograph@@ ed an offi@@ cial ad@@ ol@@ ph hit@@ ler po@@ stage stam@@ p and an im@@ it@@ ation of that stam@@ p produced by british intelligence with h@@ ans frank &apos;s image on it .
it &apos;s common@@ ly repor@@ ted in u@@ kra@@ ine that children , when leaving the or@@ phan@@ age are tar@@ ge@@ ted for human traff@@ i@@ cking , child por@@ no@@ graph@@ y and pro@@ stit@@ ution .
one of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of that ra@@ w hand on the instrument and technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
now my career may last a little longer !
and i said , &quot; well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
i say &quot; music , &quot; but actually i mean &quot; sound . &quot;
may be great there , but terrible up there .
now , i don &apos;t mean just the sound ; i mean really listen to that th@@ under within y@@ ourselves .
turned it up@@ side down , experim@@ ented with the sh@@ ell , experim@@ ented with the head .
i may feel sor@@ ro@@ w@@ ful , or happy , or ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ated , or an@@ gry when i play certain pieces of music , but i &apos;m not necessarily wan@@ ting you to feel exactly the same thing .
this is what it looks like .
it is where a third of all the traffic is going .
they mat@@ ched , they found his my@@ space .
but i think it &apos;s important to have these places .
the site has adult content on it .
and so my work , really , is trying to understand the character of that mes@@ o@@ zo@@ ic radiation compared to the cen@@ o@@ zo@@ ic radiation to see what myster@@ ies we can understand from dinosaurs and from other animals about what life on dri@@ f@@ ting contin@@ ents really can tell us about evolution .
it is the greatest transition that we have , actually , on land from one habit@@ at to another , bar none , to understand how a bon@@ y , fairly heavy , kil@@ ogra@@ m or a cou@@ ple@@ -@@ of-@@ kil@@ ogra@@ m animal could make such a transition .
but one with an im@@ men@@ se ch@@ al@@ k@@ board in the middle , with lots of little areas of dinosau@@ r rock if you could survive an expedi@@ tion .
here &apos;s the animal that was caus@@ ing it trouble .
could i have the second little video clip ?
who@@ a !
and so , in addition to dig@@ ging , i think we have some answers from the dinosau@@ r record . i think these dinosaurs migr@@ ated -- we call it dis@@ per@@ sal -- around the glo@@ be , with the sli@@ gh@@ test land bridge .
it became abstra@@ ct .
and the question is -- and we started to address this question for cent@@ u@@ ries -- as to how we get these kids involved in science .
der@@ ar@@ tu tu@@ l@@ u was ready to hang it up and reti@@ re from the sport , but she decided she &apos;d go for broke and try for one last big pay@@ day in the mar@@ que@@ e event , the new york city mar@@ ath@@ on .
when you have someone who is more competi@@ tive and more com@@ passionate than anybody else in the race , again , it &apos;s not a co@@ inci@@ dence .
in other words , early humans are eating dead animals -- no argument , that &apos;s a fact .
you can take a run@@ ner like ann tr@@ as@@ on , or ni@@ k@@ ki k@@ im@@ ball , or jen@@ n shel@@ ton , you put them in a race of 50 or 100 miles against anybody in the world and it &apos;s a co@@ in to@@ ss who &apos;s going to win .
but the advantage of that little bit of social dis@@ comfort is the fact that , when it comes to running under hot heat for long di@@ stances , we &apos;re super@@ b , we &apos;re the best on the planet .
he p@@ is@@ sed me off . let him go ch@@ ase his own an@@ tel@@ op@@ e . &quot;
we are here today . we have our digital technology .
christ@@ op@@ her mc@@ dou@@ g@@ all : are we born to run ?
and so i want to show you a special moment for me of le@@ o .
it turns out it &apos;s really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cu@@ es auto@@ matically .
and this is what we see when they use just the screen .
it had a couple of simple non-@@ verb@@ al skills it could do .
they would d@@ ress the robots .
but i want to do more than that .
but security is ti@@ ght at all the sh@@ ops . every day there are more and more cop@@ s .
as i took off with his s@@ ne@@ ak@@ ers , there was te@@ ars in his eyes .
and he hand@@ ed me a black@@ -@@ and-@@ white prin@@ ted out thesis on a po@@ et named e@@ ther@@ i@@ dge k@@ night and the oral nature of poetry , and from that point , reg@@ gie stopped becoming the best to me , because what e@@ ther@@ i@@ dge k@@ night taught me was that i could make my words sound like music , even my small ones , the mon@@ o@@ sy@@ ll@@ ables , the i@@ fs , ands , bu@@ ts , what@@ s , the gan@@ g@@ st@@ a in my s@@ lang could fall right on the ear , and from then on , i started ch@@ as@@ ing e@@ ther@@ i@@ dge k@@ night .
i &apos;m a con@@ temporary artist and i show in art g@@ aller@@ ies and muse@@ ums .
so , i continu@@ ed to work on this project of how photograph@@ y se@@ du@@ ces us and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter .
i was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day , and they were saying there &apos;s this great image of the queen sitting outside willi@@ am h@@ ill .
and it &apos;s that wish , or that desire , that i suppose i &apos;m dealing with in my work .
and i think it doesn &apos;t really matter that my work is considered hu@@ mor@@ ous , in a way ; i think it &apos;s a way in for me to deal with the importance of ima@@ gery and how we read all our information through ima@@ gery .
in africa -- where it is a major kil@@ ler -- it is totally ignor@@ ed .
it &apos;s very well known . i &apos;m not going to spend a lot of time on those .
we decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is .
we manufac@@ ture them in-@@ house , ourselves . that kee@@ ps the costs down .
i &apos;m happy to say that the things we have imple@@ mented -- 80 percent of u.s. practic@@ es do not have them , and yet the technology is there .
they need to put resources el@@ se@@ where . but we can still do it .
next stop is west african heart institute , that we are going to be doing in port har@@ cour@@ t , nigeria , as i said before . we will do other centers across west africa .
and one of my big concern@@ s with a lot of policy things today is things are getting too abstra@@ ct .
and they just kind of come up , kind of like this .
gigan@@ tic mistake : i &apos;m finding a lot of kids who need to ski@@ p al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , go right to geome@@ try and tri@@ g .
they &apos;ll be absolutely fine with the ve@@ ter@@ in@@ arian and with the hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ er , but you can &apos;t ride him .
i take all the little pieces and i put the pieces together like a puzz@@ le .
now , van go@@ gh doesn &apos;t know anything about physics , but i think it &apos;s very interesting that there was some work done to show that this ed@@ dy pattern in this painting followed a stati@@ st@@ ical model of tur@@ bul@@ ence , which brings up the whole interesting idea of maybe some of this mathematical patterns is in our own head .
what can visual thin@@ kers do when they grow up ?
so , i want to ask you a couple other questions , and if any of these feel in@@ appropriate , it &apos;s okay just to say , &quot; next question . &quot;
and this is before the internet got really big .
ah , sorry about that .
that i &apos;ll just sort of do some cele@@ sti@@ al navi@@ gation , and carry a bo@@ wie kni@@ fe in my mouth , and i &apos;ll h@@ unt fish and skin them alive and eat them , and maybe dra@@ g a des@@ al@@ ini@@ zation plant behind me for fresh water .
you have a dream and you have ob@@ stac@@ les in front of you , as we all do .
and she said , &quot; no , those are the lights of key west . &quot;
it was a very real moment , with that crowd , with my team .
thank you very much and enjoy the conference .
earlier this year , in mar@@ ch , cla@@ y took his own life .
he gets out of the military . he takes his uni@@ form off .
thank you for reading . go@@ od@@ b@@ ye . &quot;
and yet , when we look back on the prin@@ ting press in the early years , we like what happened .
now , for decades there has been a can@@ on@@ ical solution to this problem , which is to use something called and a version control system does what is says on the tin .
and then , 15 years after looking at lin@@ u@@ x and fig@@ uring out how the community worked , he said , &quot; i think i know how to write a version control system for free people . &quot;
to which i have to say , here &apos;s the thing with the sing@@ ing cat@@ s . that always happens .
part of the problem , of course , is just a lack of information .
thank you . thank you .
but even when we did that , we had to re@@ mind ourselves , sometimes there are se@@ t@@ bac@@ ks .
charles el@@ ach@@ i : now , moving from the play stuff to the serious stuff , always people ask , why do we explore ?
so it &apos;s about the size , you know , of the united states .
now you say , charles , you are really lying to us , and so on , but that &apos;s not true . we really believed they were going to last 90 days or 100 days , because they are solar powered , and mars is a du@@ sty planet , so we expected the d@@ ust would start acc@@ um@@ ul@@ ating on the surface , and after a while we wouldn &apos;t have enough power , you know , to keep them warm .
so we have a spac@@ ec@@ raft which is head@@ ing towards mars , called pho@@ en@@ i@@ x , and that spac@@ ec@@ raft will land 17 days , seven hours and 20 seconds from now , so you can ad@@ just your watch .
the fabri@@ c and the stit@@ ching could just pull apart .
so now let me talk about the next things that we are doing .
that big shi@@ el@@ d that you see outside , that &apos;s a heat shi@@ el@@ d which is going to protect it .
now , you think that those r@@ ings are very large objects .
so that &apos;s getting a lot of interest , and to show you some example of what we did in there , we actually dro@@ pped a probe , which was developed by our colleagues in europe , we dro@@ pped a probe as we were or@@ bit@@ ing saturn .
so o@@ zz@@ ie , har@@ rie@@ t and me .
we also have se@@ ven@@ -@@ day ex@@ ecu@@ tive programs .
how do you le@@ verage that information ?
only for about 20 percent of actual vis@@ its do you have to lay hands on the patient .
and i would argue , in the future , we &apos;ll have we@@ ar@@ able devices in our clo@@ th@@ es , monit@@ or@@ ing ourselves 24 / 7 .
if you haven &apos;t lost a lim@@ b -- you &apos;ve had a stro@@ ke , for example -- you can wear these aug@@ mented lim@@ bs .
now if you have trouble main@@ ta@@ ining your diet , it might help to have some extra ima@@ gery to re@@ mind you how many cal@@ ories are going to be coming at you .
le@@ ver@@ aging my knowledge of my pharma@@ co@@ genom@@ ics -- how my genes mo@@ du@@ late , what my drugs do and what do@@ ses i need are going to become increasingly important , and once in the hands of the individual and the patient , will make better drug do@@ sing and sele@@ ction available .
so we &apos;re attac@@ king the wrong target .
and i think by pul@@ ling these things together , if we can start to think about how to understand and le@@ verage these , we &apos;re going to em@@ power the patient , en@@ able the doctor , en@@ h@@ ance well@@ ness and begin to cure the well before they get sick .
when that was published in a magazine i got an i@@ rate letter from my un@@ cle .
my thinking we &apos;d meet , recognize one another , become friends , that i &apos;d ac@@ compli@@ sh a pen@@ ance .
another , different kind of po@@ em of you@@ th and age .
how rich i would think , is the le@@ xic@@ on of our self-@@ absol@@ ving .
&quot; special : big ti@@ ts , &quot; says the adverti@@ se@@ ment for a soft@@ -@@ core magazine on our neighborhood new@@ s@@ stand .
then i am dro@@ w@@ ning , in des@@ pair at having to leave her , this , everything , all , unbe@@ ar@@ able , awful .
it changed our view of the physical world .
she , better than most , knew the power of an image .
this is me . my name is ben sa@@ under@@ s .
but i realized on the morning of day one that i had no idea exactly what i &apos;d let myself in for .
the second video clip that i imag@@ ined was getting back to hea@@ throw air@@ port , and i could see again , vi@@ vi@@ dly , the camera flas@@ h@@ bul@@ bs going off , the pa@@ para@@ zz@@ i , the auto@@ graph h@@ unter@@ s , the book ag@@ ents coming to sign me up for a deal .
it was supposed to be an over@@ night stay . we were stuck there for 10 days .
later in the expedi@@ tion , the problem was no longer the ice .
so , kind of a weird combination of high-@@ tech and low-@@ tech .
i wanted to get as close to canada as i could before conditions just got too dangerous to continue .
ta@@ xi@@ ed up and down the run@@ way a few times , just to fl@@ atten it out a bit , and he said , &quot; right , i &apos;m going to -- i &apos;m going to give it a go . &quot; and he -- i &apos;ve now learned that this is standard practice , but it had me worried at the time .
what &apos;s next : ant@@ arc@@ tic@@ a .
he was going to tat@@ too little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symme@@ tri@@ c .
now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmu@@ ck .
the most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blin@@ ded by our own in@@ centi@@ ves .
no one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong .
the time had come for the men to make a plan , but they had very few op@@ tions .
fe@@ ars also have sus@@ pen@@ se .
i think the end of the story of the wh@@ al@@ es@@ hi@@ p es@@ sex off@@ ers an ill@@ umin@@ ating , if tra@@ gic , example .
imagine you &apos;re a shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ cked sa@@ il@@ or ad@@ ri@@ ft in the enormous pacific . you can choose one of three direc@@ tions and save yourself and your shi@@ p@@ mates -- but each choice comes with a fe@@ ar@@ ful con@@ sequence too . how do you choose ? in telling the story of the wh@@ al@@ es@@ hi@@ p es@@ sex , no@@ ve@@ list kar@@ en thom@@ p@@ son wal@@ ker shows how fear prop@@ els imagination , as it forces us to imagine the possible fu@@ tures and how to cop@@ e with them .
nothing happened . no violence . nothing .
but al ja@@ ze@@ era took the voice from these people and we am@@ pli@@ fied &#91; it &#93; .
because this cor@@ ru@@ pt eli@@ te in that region has lost even the power of de@@ ception .
but the values of democracy and the freedom of choice that is s@@ wee@@ ping the middle east at this moment in time is the best opportunity for the world , for the west and the east , to see st@@ ability and to see security and to see friend@@ ship and to see toler@@ ance emerging from the ar@@ ab world , rather than the images of violence and terror@@ ism .
at this moment in time , the you@@ th in the ar@@ ab world are much more wis@@ er and capable of creating the change than the old -- including the political and cultural and ide@@ ological old regi@@ mes .
now , &quot; rational &quot; is the domin@@ ant paradig@@ m in public health , and if you put your public health ner@@ d glas@@ ses on , you &apos;ll see that if we give people the information that they need about what &apos;s good for them and what &apos;s bad for them , if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information , and a little bit of motivation , people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives .
&quot; oh yeah . &quot; hundred percent .
now , the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-@@ known , ble@@ eding heart liber@@ al mar@@ gar@@ et th@@ at@@ cher .
here , maybe you &apos;ll have better lu@@ ck .
and , actually , cli@@ ents don &apos;t want to go home with a dri@@ p either .
and the other thing is that people are simply not as sc@@ ared of hiv as they were of aids , and ri@@ ghtly so .
it var@@ ies a bit pro@@ vin@@ ce to pro@@ vin@@ ce .
why , without them , you &apos;d be a total stran@@ ger . &quot;
i &apos;ll lay around ; she &apos;ll make a living .
the old jack tal@@ es that he had learned -- he talked like this , you could har@@ dly understand him . but it was really wonderful .
we were really mad at my mom . we looked out the window .
he just san@@ g : &quot; well , there &apos;s a long white ro@@ be in hea@@ ven , i know .
well , there &apos;s a long white ro@@ be in hea@@ ven , i know .
it was made to play ha@@ wa@@ i@@ ian music back in the 19@@ 20@@ s , before they had electric gu@@ it@@ ars , trying to make a l@@ oud gu@@ it@@ ar .
oh yeah , that &apos;s easier said than done .
well , obviously the next thing to do was build a can@@ n@@ on .
but we thought of it often , because every time she &apos;d co@@ ok tun@@ a surprise it made -- ta@@ sted fa@@ in@@ tly of g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der .
and this is , by the way , something that a democratic society also has to do .
and let me show you .
and not only that , they make the analog@@ y to rela@@ tivity theory and co@@ sm@@ ology often .
and what we &apos;ve been working out is the impli@@ cations , really , of the idea that the universe is made up of rela@@ tions .
you see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book .
i arrived there in september 2008 , and pretty much started to work right away .
and at the same time , i &apos;m extremely aware how bor@@ ing it is to hear about other people &apos;s happ@@ in@@ esses .
and then i told as many , many people as i possibly could about it so that there was no way that i could chicken out later on .
so then it became quite easy .
there must be something else .
that &apos;s the police , getting rid of it all .
i think it &apos;s safe to say that all humans will be inti@@ mate with death at least once in their lives .
and that &apos;s exactly what i &apos;m saying .
so by having death as a part of the cultural and social fabri@@ c of life , people &apos;s everyday decisions about their health and health@@ care are affected .
in tan@@ a tor@@ a@@ ja , we@@ dd@@ ings and bir@@ ths aren &apos;t the social gather@@ ings that kn@@ it society together . in this part of in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , big , rau@@ c@@ ous fun@@ er@@ als form the center of social life . anthropo@@ log@@ ist k@@ ell@@ i swa@@ ze@@ y takes a look at this culture , in which the bodies of dead rela@@ tives are car@@ ed for even years after they have passed . while it sounds strange to western sensi@@ bilities , she says , this could actually be a tru@@ er refle@@ ction of the fact that relationships with loved ones don &apos;t simply end when brea@@ thing does .
who will start me with $ 1,000 ? anyone ?
this man has s@@ w@@ um around the north pole , what more evidence do you want ?
&quot; i just think , you know , what people forget , gor@@ don and i , we always got on perfectly well .
it &apos;s certainly something he can rel@@ ate to .
i happen to believe it was a great er@@ ror .
but at the moment , it &apos;s a ci@@ cer@@ o thing .
and i was hop@@ ing h@@ ill@@ ary would get to the white house , because she &apos;d have been out of our home for four years .
so i &apos;ll just give you my message up front : try not to go extin@@ ct .
where are all the little ones ? &quot;
so this is where people went a@@ stra@@ y again .
now as you can imagine , cutting open a leg bone is one thing , but when you go to a museum and say , &quot; you don &apos;t mind if i cut open your dinosau@@ r &apos;s sk@@ ul@@ l do you ? &quot;
and one would think , that should give me a clu@@ e .
so we went out and colle@@ cted a whole bunch of stuff and we found a whole bunch of little ones .
so one of my graduate students , john scan@@ n@@ ell@@ a , looked through our whole colle@@ ction and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in tri@@ cer@@ at@@ ops and , of course it &apos;s open , in tor@@ osau@@ rus -- so he found the transi@@ tional ones between tri@@ cer@@ at@@ ops and tor@@ osau@@ rus , which was pretty cool .
and sure enough , nan@@ ot@@ y@@ ran@@ nu@@ s has ju@@ ven@@ i@@ le bone and the bigger one has more ma@@ ture bone .
this is an image that won us a competition for an exhi@@ bi@@ tion pa@@ vili@@ on for the s@@ wis@@ s exp@@ o 200@@ 2 on la@@ ke neu@@ ch@@ at@@ el , near gen@@ ev@@ a .
so here the world is put out of focus , while our visual depen@@ dence is put into focus .
and one of the rec@@ ur@@ ring the@@ mes , by the way , that in the work was a kind of ho@@ sti@@ li@@ ty toward the museum itself , and asking about the conven@@ tions of the museum , like the wall , the white wall .
moving along to a project that we finished about a year ago .
but we &apos;re doing it with a lot less te@@ sto@@ ster@@ one .
first we do a kind of par@@ tial box and box separ@@ ation , to take away the di@@ stra@@ ction of the sub@@ way noise .
you can see h@@ ill@@ ary clin@@ ton on the right .
so three weeks later , the times re@@ vis@@ its the story .
pa@@ m from the office .
but he did have one sugge@@ sti@@ on .
seen from another point of view , it gives quite a different impres@@ sion .
the government of india has discovered or published a study to show that this is the health@@ i@@ est building in new del@@ hi .
so i wor@@ e it when we talked about iraq .
m well the interesting part was i was asked what it was like to be the first woman secre@@ t@@ ary of state a few minutes after i &apos;d been named .
m from some people .
i think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room .
and my mot@@ to is that there &apos;s a special place in hell for women who don &apos;t help each other .
so ex@@ it the rock star .
and if you live on less than $ 1.@@ 25 a day , if you live in that kind of poverty , this is not just data .
it &apos;s called in@@ er@@ ti@@ a . it &apos;s how we scre@@ w it up .
once you have this knowledge , you can &apos;t un@@ -@@ know it .
we &apos;re going to win if we work together as one , because the power of the people is so much stron@@ ger than the people in power .
they &apos;re cell@@ -@@ ori@@ ented .
how few genes can i use ?
you look in his inte@@ st@@ ines . there are billions of bacteria .
it &apos;s got a need@@ le , like a record need@@ le , that goes back and forth over the surface , bu@@ mp@@ s up and down , and feels the hei@@ ght of the first surface .
the dna origami is a pro@@ of that that comp@@ il@@ er actually works .
it knows when to stop growing because it can count .
so you can actually make a complicated circu@@ it using a little bit of compu@@ tation .
rau@@ l mi@@ don : &quot; peace on earth &quot;
and the other is mo@@ k@@ sha@@ -@@ y@@ u@@ g access , which is integr@@ ating rural supply chain on the foun@@ da@@ tions of self-@@ help grou@@ p-@@ based micro@@ fin@@ ance .
such a service simply do not exist .
sha@@ ff@@ i , that is a really exciting business idea .
thank you so much for sharing this idea at ted .
and we &apos;ve got something a little bro@@ a@@ der like big data with a truly global foot@@ print re@@ min@@ is@@ cent of a conversation that is happening everywhere .
there &apos;s another one about personal health and nutri@@ tion .
s@@ g : so that &apos;s exactly right .
home@@ work is st@@ res@@ s@@ ful , but when you go home every day and your home is work , you don &apos;t want to pick up any as@@ sign@@ ments .
and yet , when some psych@@ ologists intervie@@ wed hospital jan@@ it@@ ors to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like , they en@@ counter@@ ed mi@@ ke , who told them about how he stopped m@@ opp@@ ing the floor because mr . j@@ ones was out of his bed getting a little exercise , trying to build up his strength , walking slowly up and down the hall .
at ted , brilli@@ ance is ra@@ mp@@ ant .
how do things like this happen ?
second , no dou@@ bt more familiar to you , is the nature of modern american education : scri@@ p@@ ted , lo@@ ck@@ -@@ step cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ a .
and they said , &quot; would you be willing to have a nuclear waste du@@ mp in your community ? &quot;
a few sources of hope : we ought to try to re-@@ mor@@ alize work .
his employees are inspired by the effort .
the camera is always on .
you have to go and stand out here a se@@ c .
if it &apos;s the gra@@ pe , they won &apos;t break it . &quot;
and i told them i &apos;d build them an arm .
he &apos;s pun@@ ching our contro@@ ls guy . the guy behind him is our engineer / surge@@ on , which is a conven@@ i@@ ent guy to have around .
&quot; look , &quot; i &apos;d say to them , &quot; we &apos;re not quite as good as nature yet .
they &apos;re not finished giving yet . &quot;
this kid was from stat@@ en island .
i don &apos;t have an answer to that . not everybody can be enti@@ t@@ led to everything simply because you were born here .
and we ought to give it to them .
the woman who as a child had ski@@ pped with him through fields and broken his heart .
i also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible .
and i think if something is done by one person it can be done by others .
then i started thinking , would it be possible to ho@@ ok up a heart / lung b@@ yp@@ ass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my ar@@ ter@@ y , and then appear to not brea@@ the while they were oxy@@ gen@@ ating my blood ?
then i learned that you have to take a huge breath , and just hold and rela@@ x and never let any air out , and just hold and rela@@ x through all the pain .
i wanted to try holding my breath everywhere .
what that does is , you start building up the red blood cell count in your body , which helps you carry oxygen better .
i completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what i needed to do .
so , i figured , op@@ ra@@ h had de@@ dic@@ ated an hour to doing this breath hold thing , if i had cra@@ cked early it would be a whole show about how depres@@ sed i am .
and i think that there is some weird thing -- that i had died or something had happened .
voice : now sim@@ mer b@@ links on flo@@ wer@@ y bra@@ es ...
okay . so , as we &apos;re talking about cambridge , let &apos;s now move on to technical advan@@ c@@ ements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the process@@ ing in these devices has grown at a really phenomen@@ al rate , and that means that i can now take c@@ ine@@ ma@@ -@@ quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here .
mm : fel@@ lo@@ ws are really good at that .
even now , man may be un@@ wi@@ tt@@ ingly changing the world &apos;s climate through the waste products of his civilization .
so humans are turning more towards animal consumption .
let &apos;s look at one case , the case of banglades@@ h .
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west ni@@ le fe@@ ver ?
more reasons to be optimi@@ stic : in the &apos; 6@@ 0s , and i am a cre@@ ature of the &apos; 6@@ 0s , there was a movement .
in the last century -- that &apos;s the one that was seven years ago -- half a billion people died from small@@ po@@ x : more than all the wars in history , more than any other infe@@ c@@ ti@@ ous disease in the history of the world .
the first wave of evolution is what we think of as dar@@ win@@ ian evolution .
it &apos;s bigger than a tiger .
these are ze@@ br@@ a fish . they &apos;re normally black and sil@@ ver .
these are two creatures that were created in order to save en@@ danger@@ ed species .
and in fact , this technology has gotten so developed that this cre@@ ature -- this is a mot@@ h -- this is the mot@@ h in its pu@@ pa stage , and that &apos;s when they put the wir@@ es in and they put in the computer technology , so that when the mot@@ h actually emer@@ ges as a mot@@ h , it is already pre@@ wired .
he took 20@@ ,000 and then 6@@ 0,000 dis@@ ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rat@@ s -- put them on a chip .
is it okay to manipu@@ late and create whatever creatures we want ?
now what is so interesting and to some , the ex@@ tent , what &apos;s a bit in@@ famous about &quot; the orig@@ in of species , &quot; is that there is only one line in it about human evolution .
and what darwin could not appreci@@ ate , or didn &apos;t perhaps want to appreci@@ ate at the time , is that there was a fundamental relationship between the inten@@ sity of ultra@@ vi@@ o@@ let radiation and skin pig@@ ment@@ ation .
when humans dis@@ per@@ sed into these la@@ ti@@ tu@@ des , what did they face ?
we &apos;re so clever we can over@@ come all of these seem@@ ing biological im@@ pe@@ di@@ ments .
they also run the risk of vi@@ tam@@ in d de@@ fi@@ ci@@ ency , if they have des@@ k jobs , like that guy .
please exc@@ use me for sitting ; i &apos;m very old .
so what i did actually is to study this problem , and i found something quite surprising .
now it &apos;s very easy to do .
something so complicated like a cloud , so un@@ stable , so var@@ ying , should have a simple rule behind it .
the things on the ground are al@@ ga@@ e .
what got you to be , at the same time , a mechan@@ ical engineer , a geogra@@ ph@@ er and a mathemati@@ cian and so on , a physi@@ c@@ ist ?
in a way , it &apos;s the story of my life .
and so my principle has been to always present the shapes with different col@@ or@@ ings because some col@@ or@@ ings em@@ ph@@ asi@@ ze that , and others it is that or that .
now , a simpli@@ stic answer would be , the doctors are doing this because they want to protect themselves leg@@ ally .
you can decide , what is your mental state : okay , i &apos;m going to choose the ca@@ ff@@ ein@@ ated te@@ a , i &apos;m going to choose the cham@@ om@@ i@@ le te@@ a .
now , the question we &apos;re asking here is in terms of the out@@ come , in terms of the number of puzz@@ les solved , will you in the driver &apos;s seat end up solving more puzz@@ les , because you are in control , you could decide which te@@ a you will choose , or would you be better off , in terms of the number of puzz@@ les solved ?
vol@@ a@@ ti@@ le stock market , getting negative feedback that &apos;s also immedi@@ ate .
after all , happiness is not just a privi@@ lege for the lucky few , but a fundamental human right for all .
the real question is , how can markets be developed in rural africa to har@@ ness the power of innovation and entreprene@@ ur@@ ship that we know exists ?
it also has very high cost impli@@ cations .
there was a very influ@@ enti@@ al book about that , which was main@@ ly about getting governments out of the market .
china &apos;s d@@ ali@@ an com@@ modi@@ ty exchange , three years ago , 2004 , over@@ took the chicago board of trade to become the second largest com@@ modi@@ ty exchange in the world .
so all of this will transform farmers .
about the size of the great wall of china , this would har@@ dly be an invisible structure .
it was here in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s and early &apos; 7@@ 0s that major dr@@ ou@@ ghts brought three million people to become depen@@ dent upon emergen@@ cy food aid , with about up to 2@@ 50,000 dying .
and still , those extreme environments are very good places if we want to stop the shif@@ ting sands .
the whole c@@ em@@ entation process takes about 24 hours .
some people believe that this would spread un@@ controll@@ ably , and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way .
we &apos;ve identi@@ fied the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tra@@ c@@ tors , bread o@@ v@@ ens , circu@@ it makers .
and the same is starting to happen with hard@@ ware too .
but that day , when i asked that question , i learned something , and that was that i &apos;d grown up thinking that a toi@@ let like that was my right , when in fact it &apos;s a privi@@ lege .
and the cost to the world is im@@ men@@ se : 2@@ 60 billion dollars lost every year on the los@@ ses to poor san@@ it@@ ation .
we &apos;ve all done that , but they do it every day , and when they hit pu@@ ber@@ ty and they start men@@ stru@@ ating , it just gets too much .
so the really interesting , exciting work -- this is the eng@@ aging bit -- in san@@ it@@ ation is that we need to understand human psych@@ ology .
kids were dying of di@@ arr@@ he@@ a and chol@@ era .
things are going wrong here too .
we know that hur@@ ri@@ can@@ es have always happened in the past . &quot;
well , that &apos;s what it &apos;s like now , but this is what it was like in the 195@@ 0s from the same boat in the same place on the same board on the same do@@ ck .
it &apos;s a bit of an embar@@ ras@@ s@@ ment .
and as it comes to sh@@ ore and the wind blo@@ ws , and little dro@@ ple@@ ts of the water get into the air , the emergen@@ cy rooms of all the hospit@@ als fill up with people with ac@@ ute res@@ pir@@ atory dist@@ ress .
and the al@@ ga@@ e give the cor@@ als sugar , and the cor@@ als give the al@@ ga@@ e nutri@@ ents and protection .
the con@@ sequence of that is that all those nutri@@ ents that fuel the great an@@ cho@@ v@@ et@@ a fis@@ her@@ ies , of the sar@@ din@@ es of california or in per@@ u or whatever , those slow down and those fis@@ her@@ ies collap@@ se .
now , i am not a scientist .
occasi@@ on@@ ally , kids would come and join me and watch , but their ne@@ cks soon got sor@@ e , and they would go off to the bo@@ ar@@ d@@ walk to play video games and m@@ ing@@ le with humans .
giant , al@@ mon@@ d-@@ sha@@ ped , un@@ blin@@ king eyes ?
i was mer@@ ely a con@@ no@@ is@@ se@@ ur of movies fe@@ atur@@ ing desert planets , as i still am .
this book became , naturally , an enormous be@@ st-@@ s@@ eller .
make of that what you will .
and that &apos;s when the li@@ beri@@ ans came along .
the ir@@ ony is , though , that we have cas@@ he@@ d-@@ out pro@@ sper@@ ity almost literally in terms of money and economic growth .
so i want to just spend a couple of minutes on system dynam@@ ics .
but this -- i just want to show you some data here .
it was a sun@@ day ev@@ ening , sun@@ day after@@ noon , and it was just after -- actually , to be honest , too long after -- we had moved into a new house .
no@@ vel@@ ty is adap@@ tive when things are changing and you need to ada@@ pt yourself .
it &apos;s a form , if you like , of e@@ col@@ o@@ gical al@@ tru@@ ism -- perhaps something along those lines . maybe it &apos;s that .
pro@@ sper@@ ity is a shared en@@ dea@@ vor .
but actually opening up the space to think about different ways of gover@@ ning , different kinds of politics , and creating the space for civil society and businesses to operate differently -- absolutely vi@@ tal .
i wanted to think about what else i could put sha@@ dows on , and i thought of my friend ber@@ nie .
i was teaching myself how to paint in all these different sty@@ les , and i wanted to see what else i could do with it .
so this is what happens as that burn gets going .
when the pre@@ stige s@@ ank off the coast of spa@@ in , there were big , flo@@ ating c@@ us@@ hi@@ ons the size of so@@ f@@ a c@@ us@@ hi@@ ons of em@@ ul@@ si@@ fied oil , with the consi@@ sten@@ cy , or the vis@@ co@@ sity , of che@@ wing g@@ um .
well , the reason is , is because , when we &apos;re buying gas , we &apos;re very invest@@ ed in this sort of cognitive dis@@ son@@ ance .
but in many ways , that image of the con@@ spi@@ ra@@ cy still sti@@ cks with us .
we look at these pictures and we understand , for the first time , our role in this supply chain .
one of the places we put in a big oil project in ch@@ ad , with ex@@ x@@ on .
and the same thing happens at the 50@@ th per@@ centi@@ le , around 8@@ 0,000 .
they &apos;re up at new@@ americ@@ a@@ .@@ net .
well , you probably recognize the first person .
and here she rel@@ ates , in the docum@@ ent@@ ary film &quot; afgh@@ an star , &quot; how her friends ur@@ ged her not to do this and told her that she was leaving them for democracy .
cy@@ n@@ th@@ ia schnei@@ der looks at two international &quot; american i@@ do@@ l &quot; -@@ style shows -- one in afghanistan , and one in the united ar@@ ab e@@ mir@@ ates -- and shows the surprising effect that these real@@ it@@ y-@@ tv competi@@ tions are creating in their societies .
the other thing which was so challen@@ ging about this swim is not just the al@@ titude .
i &apos;ve heard it said that dro@@ w@@ ning is the most pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful death that you can have .
and taking that into the world of climate change -- which is , frank@@ ly , the mt . ever@@ est of all problems -- just because we &apos;ve lived the way we have lived for so long , just because we have consum@@ ed the way we have for so long and popul@@ ated the earth the way we have for so long , doesn &apos;t mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .
and i was laugh@@ ing about this with the very smart colleagues i have , and said , &quot; you know , well , if i have to talk about the future , what is it ? &quot;
in this case , he &apos;s done self-@@ replic@@ ation of a complex 3d structure .
and so you &apos;ve got this sort of replic@@ ating system .
not just where you atta@@ ch a micro@@ -@@ controll@@ er to the end point , but that the structure and the mechanis@@ ms are the lo@@ gic , are the computers .
and under no load , it &apos;s one structure .
i &apos;ve gone too far . so that sounds like it &apos;s it .
however , it &apos;s hard sometimes to remember the ex@@ tent of that ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation .
and we find that when we do that , we can , in fact , have a few places that are really hyper@@ -@@ den@@ se within a wi@@ der fabri@@ c of places that are perhaps a little more comfortable and achieve the same results .
and so what we do is we buy these dri@@ ll@@ s that have a potential capacity of thousands of hours of dri@@ ll time , use them once or twice to put a hole in the wall and let them sit .
do they allow for pol@@ lin@@ ation , pol@@ lin@@ ator path@@ ways that bees and bu@@ tter@@ flies and such can come back into our cities ?
well , let &apos;s click the zo@@ om l@@ ens down one order of magni@@ tude , and look at the century scale .
well , why has violence dec@@ lin@@ ed ? no one really knows , but i have read four explan@@ ations , all of which , i think , have some gra@@ in of pl@@ au@@ si@@ bility . the first is , maybe thomas ho@@ b@@ bes got it right . he was the one who said that life in a state of nature was &quot; soli@@ t@@ ary , poor , na@@ sty , bru@@ tish and short . &quot; not because , he argu@@ ed , humans have some pri@@ mor@@ di@@ al thir@@ st for blood or ag@@ gressi@@ ve instin@@ ct or terri@@ tor@@ ial im@@ per@@ ative , but because of the lo@@ gic of an@@ arch@@ y . in a state of an@@ arch@@ y , there &apos;s a const@@ ant temp@@ tation to inv@@ ade your neighb@@ ors pre@@ emp@@ tively , before they inv@@ ade you . more recently , thomas sch@@ elling gives the analog@@ y of a home@@ ow@@ ner who he@@ ars a ru@@ st@@ ling in the bas@@ ement . being a good american , he has a pi@@ sto@@ l in the ni@@ ght@@ stand , pul@@ ls out his gun , and wal@@ ks down the sta@@ irs .
whatever its causes , the dec@@ line of violence , i think , has profound impli@@ cations . it should force us to ask not just , why is there war ? but also , why is there peace ? not just , what are we doing wrong ? but also , what have we been doing right ?
now dam@@ ien knows all about con@@ dom@@ s , but he doesn &apos;t sell them .
thank you .
it &apos;s about the ba@@ th@@ room and the kitchen . if you have so@@ ap , water and food , you know , you can live long .
and we will then see a completely different picture .
so they come in with the two perspe@@ c@@ tives i have , you know ?
and this is the number of people .
then you see si@@ er@@ ra le@@ one and mau@@ ri@@ ti@@ us , completely different .
it &apos;s just that we would like to up@@ grade our international agen@@ cies to deal with the world in the modern way , as we do .
they started very well . they used the aid well .
all these green countries are achie@@ ving mil@@ len@@ ni@@ um development goals .
if i spli@@ t tanz@@ ania in its income , the ri@@ cher 20 percent in tanz@@ ania has more hiv than the poor@@ est one .
don &apos;t get conf@@ used of the progress of the emerging econom@@ ies and the great capacity of people in the middle income countries and in pe@@ ac@@ e@@ ful low income countries .
if you &apos;re just talking about social structure , ok , clearly that &apos;s gotten more complex a little over the last 10,000 years -- has reach@@ ed higher and higher levels .
point is : there &apos;s obviously collaboration and organization going on beyond national bo@@ unds .
and you have to read your ancient history to realize what a revolution that has been , ok . this was not a pre@@ valent view , few thousand years ago , and i at@@ tribu@@ te it to this non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum dynamic .
so , what do we do ? well , first of all , we can do a lot more with arms control , the international regu@@ lation of dangerous technologies .
i also like it because it &apos;s an in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally kind of mor@@ ally re@@ de@@ em@@ ing exercise .
it &apos;s going to be hard . i say we give it a shot anyway because we &apos;ve just come too far to scre@@ w it up now .
africa has im@@ men@@ se opportunities that never navi@@ gate through the web of des@@ pair and hel@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness that the western media lar@@ gely pres@@ ents to its audience .
we need to put money where it can produ@@ c@@ tively grow .
so , i want to argue today that the fundamental source of africa &apos;s in@@ ability to engage the rest of the world in a more productive relationship is because it has a poor institu@@ tional and policy frame@@ work .
in the process , we , the african people , have been si@@ del@@ ined from the poli@@ cy@@ -@@ making , poli@@ cy@@ -@@ ori@@ entation , and poli@@ cy@@ - imple@@ ment@@ ation process in our countries .
but this shows you that the government of uganda is not commit@@ ted to spending its own re@@ venue to invest in productive invest@@ ments , but rather it de@@ vot@@ es this re@@ venue to paying structure of public expen@@ di@@ ture .
so they came to me -- c@@ n@@ n -- and they said , &quot; professor se@@ li@@ g@@ man , would you tell us about the state of psych@@ ology today ?
and now , when i tell people what i do , they move toward me .
the first is that psych@@ ology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with we@@ ak@@ ness .
and we find that we &apos;ve been able to manu@@ alize many of them , and we actually carry out random as@@ sign@@ ment eff@@ ic@@ acy and effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess studies .
but in the third great ar@@ en@@ a of life , love , len is an ab@@ y@@ s@@ mal failure .
hat@@ ed the job .
i hope all of you have such a person .
is health a function of positive engagement , of pleasure , and of meaning in life ?
this is an ic@@ on of national geographic , an afgh@@ an re@@ fu@@ ge@@ e taken by steve mc@@ cur@@ ry .
but i turned away for a moment , and he got caught into a ri@@ p@@ ti@@ de and started to be pulled out towards the je@@ tty .
so i &apos;m going to share with you some co@@ ver@@ ages that i feel demon@@ strate the stor@@ y@@ telling power of photograph@@ y .
an@@ nie had been killed , along with 20 members of her her@@ d .
here , in a photo by brian , a seem@@ ingly cru@@ ci@@ fied shar@@ k is caught up in a g@@ ill net off of ba@@ ja .
but there are also times when photogra@@ pher@@ s simply en@@ coun@@ ter things that are , when it comes down to it , just pla@@ in fun .
go back and get them , and then bring them back and drop them in front of him .
we sho@@ ot all of these photographs in about three seconds .
and this is what we used to give to the company image me@@ tri@@ cs to create a ri@@ g@@ ged , digital version of e@@ mi@@ ly .
and let &apos;s take a look at a computer@@ -@@ gener@@ ated version of bru@@ ce , running in a new environment .
so , i did tro@@ pic@@ al ec@@ ology and plant bot@@ any .
con@@ go has five of the world &apos;s rich@@ est sites of prote@@ cted area , and the o@@ kap@@ i fa@@ un@@ al reser@@ ve is one of them .
purpose : so that we start them for agriculture , for medicine , for whatever , and for science , for the study of the fl@@ or@@ a and the change of the forest .
with friends , we had been sitting and watching match foot@@ ball , and having some good music with world@@ space radio , when it started , i think .
sometimes , they talk to my own language , that is , l@@ ing@@ ala .
and for that , they have been having big pressure to leave , to free the area .
and that is -- i think it &apos;s difficult for me .
and i think , helping us , people are acting sometimes by ignor@@ ance .
in many theme par@@ ks , you can pay extra to jump to the head of the line .
that &apos;s one reason to worry .
michael san@@ del : takes the in@@ trin@@ si@@ c in@@ cen@@ tive away .
market exchange , they assu@@ me , doesn &apos;t change the meaning or value of the goods being ex@@ changed .
do we want a society where everything is up for s@@ ale , or are there certain moral and ci@@ vi@@ c goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy ?
that last down@@ ward not@@ ch in the red line is not actual data .
we &apos;ve got problems all over our edu@@ cational system despite race to the top .
then they had to bring them in .
electri@@ fication , central heat , ow@@ ner@@ ship of motor cars , they all went from zero to 100 percent .
that was an es@@ say i wrote when i was 11 years old and i got a b + .
also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trau@@ ma .
and it &apos;s also one that , i think , many of our scientists have been asking .
it was something i read in an edi@@ tor@@ ial by a woman who was talking about the war in iraq . and she said , &quot; save a man from dro@@ w@@ ning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
and when i have the question , it is a focus .
in writing a story , it is the place where i begin .
and it was a man , a chinese man , and he was stac@@ king these things , not with gl@@ ue , not with anything .
and i began to sense something different about the history , and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your jo@@ ys , and your ritu@@ als , your tradi@@ tions , your links with other families . and i saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility .
we &apos;ve come to the end of the talk , and i will reve@@ al what is in the bag , and it is the mus@@ e , and it is the things that transform in our lives , that are wonderful and stay with us .
you take the profit from that to buy more ads .
they &apos;ve come out ... ar@@ by &apos;s is going to spend 85 million dollars pro@@ mot@@ ing an o@@ ven mit@@ t with the voice of tom ar@@ n@@ old , hop@@ ing that that will get people to go to ar@@ by &apos;s and buy a ro@@ ast bee@@ f sandwi@@ ch .
because it &apos;s new , because it &apos;s fresh .
i think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they &apos;re really good at ignor@@ ing you .
so when steve jobs talks to 50,000 people at his key@@ note , right , who are all tun@@ ed in from 1@@ 30 countries watching his two-@@ hour commercial -- that &apos;s the only thing keeping his company in business -- is that those 50,000 people care des@@ per@@ ately enough to watch a two-@@ hour commercial , and then tell their friends .
the first one is : design is free when you get to scale .
this is a map of so@@ ap la@@ ke , washington .
and i started spra@@ ying that on the streets in ca@@ ir@@ o .
ba@@ hi@@ a she@@ hab : a thousand times no
all of the western religi@@ ons begin with the notion of e@@ den , and des@@ c@@ end through a kind of prof@@ li@@ gate present to a very ug@@ ly future .
the story i wanted to do ini@@ tially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals mi@@ gra@@ te down from the can@@ adi@@ an arc@@ tic to the gul@@ f of st . la@@ wr@@ ence in canada to engage in cour@@ ts@@ hi@@ p , ma@@ ting and to have their pu@@ ps .
the first compon@@ ent of the story that i thought was essential , however , was to give re@@ a@@ ders a sense of appreci@@ ation for the ocean animals that they were eating .
but this one morning i jum@@ ped in and found this th@@ res@@ her that had just recently died in the g@@ ill net .
and i went to the island of b@@ im@@ in@@ i , in the ba@@ ham@@ as , to work with le@@ mon shar@@ k pu@@ ps .
another char@@ is@@ matic me@@ g@@ af@@ a@@ un@@ a species that i worked with is the story i did on the right wh@@ ale .
and i wanted to close this program with a story of hope , a story i did on marine reser@@ ves as sort of a solution to the problem of over@@ fishing , the global fish crisis story .
i was walking in the market one day with my wife , and somebody stuck a c@@ age in my face .
no . everyone should be able to follow this .
so how &apos;s this possible ?
but is it really that easy ?
this is what it looks like : the people have to ta@@ p them twice a day -- just a milli@@ meter sli@@ ce -- and the only thing you harv@@ est is sugar water , carbon dio@@ xi@@ de , rain fall and a little bit of s@@ uns@@ h@@ ine .
if you look at the number of tree species we have in europe , for instance , from the ur@@ als up to england , you know how many ?
so this is the sam@@ bo@@ ja le@@ star@@ i area .
we have the zone with the sugar pal@@ ms , and then we have this f@@ ence with very th@@ or@@ ny pal@@ ms to keep the or@@ an@@ gu@@ t@@ ans -- that we provide with a place to live in the middle -- and the people apart .
now i think the real key to doing it , to give a simple answer , is inte@@ gration .
str@@ ings atta@@ ched to dan@@ cers .
r@@ m : well some of them definitely have a direct obser@@ vation -- like literally two rain@@ dro@@ ps fall@@ ing , and just watching that pattern is so stun@@ ning .
every problem in a city has to have its own equ@@ ation of co-@@ responsibility and also a design .
which is bo@@ got@@ a , and they did a very good job .
i &apos;m trying to say we have to com@@ bine all the systems , and with one condition : never -- if you have a sub@@ way , if you have surface systems , if you have any kind of system -- never compe@@ te in the same space .
par@@ ks -- old quar@@ ries that they were trans@@ formed into par@@ ks .
you care about science , philosoph@@ y , music , art , whatever -- it &apos;s no good if you &apos;re a z@@ om@@ b@@ ie or in a com@@ a , right ?
and i have only one real message in this lec@@ ture , and that is , consciousness is a biological phenomenon like photo@@ syn@@ thesis , di@@ ge@@ sti@@ on , mit@@ o@@ sis -- you know all the biological phenomen@@ a -- and once you accept that , most , though not all , of the hard problems about consciousness simply ev@@ apo@@ rate .
it begins in the morning when you wake up from a dre@@ am@@ less sleep , and it goes on all day until you fall as@@ le@@ ep or die or otherwise become un@@ conscious .
it &apos;s real and ir@@ redu@@ ci@@ ble .
it &apos;s really a digital computer program running in your brain and that &apos;s what we need to do to create consciousness is get the right program .
but we have this per@@ si@@ stent con@@ fusion between obje@@ c@@ tivity and subje@@ c@@ tivity as fe@@ atures of reality and obje@@ c@@ tivity and subje@@ c@@ tivity as fe@@ atures of cla@@ im@@ s .
so i suppose you could multi@@ p@@ ly that by 20 or something to get the number of people who &apos;ve seen it .
they get no great pleasure from what they do .
he said this in dec@@ ember 18@@ 6@@ 2 to the second an@@ nu@@ al meeting of con@@ gress .
now that &apos;s a great deal of us , isn &apos;t it ?
certain sorts of college .
when i arrived in l@@ .@@ a .
i worked out recently that i was given a gu@@ it@@ ar as a kid at about the same time that eric c@@ lap@@ ton got his first gu@@ it@@ ar .
and doing that , i think , is the answer to the future because it &apos;s not about sc@@ aling a new solution ; it &apos;s about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions , but with ex@@ ternal support based on a person@@ alized cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um .
i want to show you a couple of examples why .
for instance , commit@@ ting 10,000 soldiers to the next battle sounds like a lot .
and my mother came up and said , &quot; what on earth are you doing ? &quot;
it &apos;s my response , my at@@ titude , to op@@ pres@@ sion that i &apos;ve got control over , and that i can do something about .
and you talk to the fear and you ask it what it wants , what it needs .
and it brings me to the cru@@ x of what &apos;s going on , or what i percei@@ ve as going on , in the world today , which is that last century was top@@ -@@ down power .
and after about two minutes , everybody moved asi@@ de and went home .
and this open-@@ hear@@ te@@ dness is exactly what i &apos;ve experienced in the entire organization of this gather@@ ing since i got here yesterday .
so , imagine we &apos;re in the middle of america .
or can we do it as an ex@@ clu@@ sive mem@@ bran@@ e ?
there &apos;s a hole at the an@@ us , pen@@ is level .
and the solution i offer is to the biggest cul@@ pr@@ it in this massive mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment of the earth by human@@ kind , and the resul@@ ting dec@@ line of the bio@@ sphere .
still it works to help us understand the problem .
water us@@ age is down 75 percent in our worldwide car@@ pet ti@@ le business .
and the go@@ od@@ will of the market@@ place is aston@@ ishing .
if we , a pe@@ tro@@ -@@ inten@@ sive company can do it , anybody can .
and we have a choice to make during our brief , brief visit to this beautiful blue and green living planet : to hurt it or to help it .
but as particular as they feel to us , we know we &apos;re not alone .
but the number of arts partici@@ pants , people who write poetry , who sing son@@ gs , who per@@ form in church cho@@ irs , is explo@@ ding beyond our wil@@ dest imag@@ in@@ ations .
we work to pro@@ mote healthy vi@@ br@@ ant societies , to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate human suffering , to pro@@ mote a more thou@@ ght@@ ful , substan@@ tive , em@@ path@@ ic world order .
and the good news is i don &apos;t have a prepared speech , but i have a box of sli@@ des .
and the bis@@ ho@@ p adop@@ ted me as his kid .
and i got 60 pieces out of it for my school because i felt that wel@@ f@@ are mom@@ s and ex@@ -@@ steel workers and single parents deser@@ ved to come to a school where there was hand@@ cra@@ f@@ ted fur@@ ni@@ ture that gre@@ et@@ ed them every day .
and most importantly , he lo@@ an@@ ed me the head of research for the h@@ ein@@ z company .
and i will guar@@ an@@ tee you that if you come to my center in pit@@ ts@@ bur@@ gh -- and you &apos;re all invited -- you &apos;ll see wel@@ f@@ are mothers doing analy@@ tical chemistry with log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic calcul@@ ators 10 months from en@@ roll@@ ing in the program .
we have cer@@ am@@ ics and photograph@@ y and computer ima@@ ging .
i wanted you to see this g@@ aller@@ y because it &apos;s as good as it gets .
he said , &quot; because i heard you built the center and i didn &apos;t believe that you did it , and i wanted to see for myself .
and he was there , ti@@ to pu@@ ente .
so , the h@@ is@@ pan@@ ics and the black folks have formed a partner@@ ship to grow high technology or@@ chi@@ ds in the middle of the inner city .
i said , &quot; well , where would you build this thing ? &quot;
and i ran the story and i said , &quot; what do you think ? &quot;
i am ban@@ king on you and i &apos;m ban@@ king on guys like her@@ b@@ ie and qu@@ in@@ cy and ha@@ ck@@ et@@ t and richard and very de@@ cent people who still believe in something .
then what happens is the re@@ tin@@ al circu@@ it@@ ry , the middle part , goes to work on it , and what it does is it per@@ forms oper@@ ations on it , it extra@@ cts information from it , and it conver@@ ts that information into a code .
here are three sets of fir@@ ing patterns . the top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that &apos;s been treated with this en@@ co@@ der@@ -@@ trans@@ duc@@ er device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard pro@@ s@@ thetic .
so just the same way that we were able to jump over the dama@@ ged circu@@ it@@ ry in the re@@ tin@@ a to get to the re@@ tin@@ a &apos;s out@@ put cells , we can jump over the dama@@ ged circu@@ it@@ ry in the co@@ ch@@ le@@ a to get the audi@@ tory ner@@ ve , or jump over dama@@ ged areas in the cortex , in the motor cortex , to bridge the gap produced by a stro@@ ke .
but they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well .
the reason that vi@@ bri@@ o fis@@ cher@@ i is doing that comes from the biology .
so now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
and that &apos;s de@@ pic@@ ted on this slide . this is your skin .
of course , you &apos;ve just heard and you already know that we &apos;re running out of antibio@@ tics .
of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be mul@@ tic@@ ell@@ ular .
all of those people are between 20 and 30 years old , and they are the engine that dri@@ ves scientific discovery in this country .
who should get the best ones ?
ari@@ st@@ ot@@ le had a different reason for saying the best flu@@ tes should go to the best fl@@ ute players .
how many would rule in fa@@ vor of cas@@ ey martin ?
audience : the en@@ dur@@ ance element is a very important part of the game , walking all those holes .
and the su@@ pre@@ me cour@@ t ju@@ st@@ ices w@@ rest@@ led with that question .
so if gol@@ fing is the kind of game that can be played while ri@@ ding around in a golf c@@ art , it would be hard to con@@ fer on the gol@@ fing gre@@ ats the status that we con@@ fer , the honor and recogni@@ tion that goes to truly great ath@@ le@@ tes .
what &apos;s your vision for the next phase of this ?
now , i want to ask a question .
but the question is , are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they out@@ wei@@ gh the down@@ side of doing the opposite , nam@@ ely , leaving aging as it is ?
so that &apos;s all i &apos;m going to say about that .
there are fundamental , major break@@ through@@ s , and there are incre@@ mental re@@ fin@@ ements of those break@@ through@@ s .
and that &apos;s quite a thought .
that will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is ine@@ vi@@ table in humans , since it &apos;s been post@@ pon@@ ed so very effectively in mi@@ ce .
but i would like to cla@@ im to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that quali@@ fy as damage , side effects of me@@ tab@@ oli@@ s@@ m that cause path@@ ology in the end , or that might cause path@@ ology .
so , you know , this does happen .
a@@ g : if you lose a bit of weight .
i &apos;m here to tell you the story of au@@ du@@ r capital , which is a financial fir@@ m fo@@ unded by me and kri@@ stin -- who you see in the picture -- in the spring of 2007 , just over a year before the economic collap@@ se hit .
we care how we make our profit .
they mar@@ ched into the center of re@@ y@@ k@@ ja@@ vi@@ k , and they put women &apos;s issues onto the agenda .
by sub@@ urban spra@@ w@@ l , i re@@ fer to the re@@ organization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requi@@ re@@ ment of automo@@ bile use , and that the automo@@ bile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas@@ -@@ bel@@ ching , ti@@ me@@ -@@ wa@@ sting and life@@ -@@ thre@@ at@@ ening pro@@ s@@ thetic device that many of us need just to , most americans , in fact , need , just to live their daily lives .
these are all ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations , s@@ light ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ations of a fundamental truth , which is port@@ lan@@ ders spend a lot more on re@@ creation of all kinds than the rest of america .
well guess what ? if you lived in a more wal@@ k@@ able neighborhood , you were 35 percent likely to be over@@ weight .
it &apos;s not whether you &apos;re in the city or not , it &apos;s how is your city designed ?
so obviously , we can do better , and we want to do better , and we &apos;re all trying to be green .
so sustain@@ ability , which inclu@@ des our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustain@@ ability .
no animal , let alone a fro@@ g , has been known to do this , to change one organ in the body into another .
it &apos;s not a fro@@ g . but it &apos;s a long way along the journey to producing , or bringing back , an extin@@ ct species .
at any rate , it was a fascinating place , but unfortunately , australia didn &apos;t stay this way .
the gene@@ ti@@ ci@@ sts laugh@@ ed . but this was six years before dol@@ ly .
okay , if we can do this , could we put it back ?
they were being kept as pe@@ ts , and we know a lot of bush tal@@ es and memor@@ ies of people who had them as pe@@ ts , and they say they were wonderful , friend@@ ly .
ex@@ ternal de@@ bt -- something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest deb@@ ts on the continent -- has come down dra@@ matically .
one of the things we asked them recently was what &apos;s their top issue .
and i want to tell you something .
i &apos;m sure some of you who are not so young will remember those pictures .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
the e@@ u trans@@ fer@@ red 10 billion . where did they use it ?
they want to visit us , see what &apos;s happening on the ground and make a decision .
but it cannot do it alone .
so we can make a cat@@ aly@@ tic to help us provide some of that .
she needs another 20 million .
and i think there &apos;s some sub-@@ questions there that i put there .
and it &apos;s been used since the &apos; 9@@ 0s to study really complex processes .
were they in fact just playing a lot more notes when they were impro@@ vis@@ ing ?
mp : no@@ pe . nothing &apos;s in my po@@ ckets . nur@@ se : okay .
and so i &apos;ve always been fascin@@ ated by fre@@ e-@@ style .
this is a short video of how we actually do this in a scan@@ ner .
i mean , don &apos;t get me wrong . calcul@@ us is an important subject .
well , it sounds like a pretty good idea , but this task , as br@@ un@@ o mentioned , isn &apos;t an easy one for two main reasons : first , the dete@@ ction algorith@@ ms .
he &apos;s obviously not jo@@ an@@ ne -- so we &apos;ll &quot; add user . &quot;
but with &quot; disappe@@ ar , &quot; there &apos;s really no anal@@ o@@ gi@@ es -- so ev@@ an , what you want to do here is to imagine the cu@@ be slowly fa@@ ding out , okay .
now s@@ mile to go straight .
now , this is our second generations prototyp@@ e .
you can distribu@@ te bed nets , and bed nets are very effective if you use them .
so here &apos;s an image of red blood cells , and now we can actually map where the he@@ mo@@ zo@@ in and where the malaria par@@ as@@ ites are inside those red blood cells .
and then , of course , the next year it comes ro@@ aring back .
well , we could protect very high-@@ value tar@@ gets like clin@@ ics .
eric jo@@ han@@ son : what we have here is a t@@ ank on the other side of the stage .
restaurants and the food industry in general are pretty much the most wa@@ ste@@ ful industry in the world .
cha@@ irs : recycl@@ ed and recycl@@ able .
rather than me putting a dis@@ h down , they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted .
this restaurant looks a little bit like ac@@ or@@ n house -- same cha@@ irs , same tables .
five weeks old , it &apos;s my baby , and it &apos;s hur@@ ting real bad .
so these three are not perfect -- they &apos;re ideas .
on a good day , i &apos;ll have maybe three or four seconds that i really want to choose , but i &apos;ll just have to nar@@ row it down to one , but even nar@@ ro@@ wing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway .
i think it would be interesting to see what everyone did with a project like this .
t@@ j : this is a her@@ d , and it is built according to gene@@ tical co@@ des .
can i have the feel@@ er here ?
thank you very much , ladies and gentle@@ men .
so once we realized that we could make 5@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ base pair vir@@ al-@@ si@@ zed pieces , we thought , we at least have the means then to try and make seri@@ ally lots of these pieces to be able to eventually assem@@ ble them together to make this me@@ ga base chromo@@ some .
and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromo@@ som@@ es out of ye@@ ast and transp@@ l@@ ant them .
so early on , we developed the notion of putting in water@@ mar@@ ks in the dna to absolutely make clear that the dna was syn@@ thetic .
yes , in the back .
but the thing is , how come it &apos;s news to most people ?
and yet the more you add , the more seems to go missing .
because the kor@@ an is quite clear when it says that you &apos;ll be &quot; a new creation in par@@ ad@@ ise &quot; and that you will be &quot; re@@ created in a form un@@ known to you , &quot; which seems to me a far more appe@@ aling pro@@ spe@@ ct than a virg@@ in .
here &apos;s my study site . this is really a picture of ants , and the rab@@ bit just happens to be there .
they go out , they get the food , they dig the nest , and the queen never comes out again .
so , with nobody telling anybody what to do , how is it that the col@@ ony man@@ ages to ad@@ just the numbers of workers per@@ forming each task ?
they bring it back and feed it to the lar@@ va@@ e .
so i did experiments where i changed one thing .
but if more nest ma@@ inten@@ ance work is needed -- for example , if i put out a bunch of to@@ o@@ th@@ pi@@ cks -- then nobody will ever switch back to nest ma@@ inten@@ ance , they have to get nest ma@@ inten@@ ance workers from inside the nest .
and i &apos;ll tell you a little bit more about that .
so , we do a lot of simulation and mod@@ el@@ ing , and also experiment@@ al work , to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise com@@ bine to , in the ag@@ gre@@ gate , produce the predic@@ table behavior of ant col@@ on@@ ies .
it &apos;s the same energy question that you &apos;re looking at today , but it &apos;s different sources of fuel .
if you look at where they &apos;re loc@@ ated -- and on this slide it &apos;s the red blo@@ bs on there -- there are five that are operating in the mi@@ d-@@ east , and the rest of them are in the united states .
if you go forward the next 10 years and ca@@ p the price of oil at 100 dollars a bar@@ re@@ l , you will pay 2.@@ 2 trilli@@ on .
it &apos;s what we use a year .
thanks for that .
somebody the other day said i was the second largest natural gas produ@@ cer in the united states .
do you support the idea of some kind of price on carbon ?
i wit@@ n@@ essed my first fra@@ ck job at bor@@ der texas in 195@@ 3 .
why ? air quality was the reason they used natural gas and got away from dies@@ el .
for one thing , both were very real .
this guy , dr . tol@@ and , went by covered wa@@ g@@ on to california .
the in@@ humanity which this tra@@ il has been wit@@ ness to , the hear@@ t@@ break and suffering which so many have under@@ gone , cannot be imag@@ ined . they certainly cannot be described . &quot;
you know , it can be used as an incredible means of trans@@ mit@@ ting power .
the electric ir@@ on , also very big .
the next thing that really was a big , big deal was the wash@@ ing machine .
this is what it looks like under my des@@ k .
199@@ 8 : &quot; ama@@ zon@@ .@@ to@@ ast@@ . &quot; in 199@@ 9 : &quot; ama@@ zon@@ .@@ bom@@ b. &quot;
in the beginning , there was compassion , and i mean not just when human beings first showed up , but actually even before that .
the bad news is this doesn &apos;t bring us universal compassion by itself .
so , the fact that the gol@@ den rule is in some sense built in to us is not , by itself , going to bring us universal love .
it &apos;s going to either be win@@ -@@ win or lo@@ se@@ -@@ lose for them .
environmental problems , in many ways , put us all in the same boat .
and if you tell them , &quot; well , they think america dis@@ respe@@ cts them and even wants to domin@@ ate them , and they hate america .
most disease is cor@@ related with poverty , but in the case of childhood can@@ cers , the children who were dying seemed mostly to come from aff@@ lu@@ ent families .
a child a week was dying , but nothing changed .
and the more i &apos;ve thought about this , the more i think , really , that that &apos;s a kind of love .
he was afraid of doing damage to the patients he was trying to help .
open information is fantastic , open networks are essential .
trilli@@ on !
every one of those blue cells are a cancer gene inside a cancer cell , and they &apos;re part of the fe@@ a@@ ther .
but how does context signal ?
and in order to show you that the mal@@ ig@@ nant phen@@ ot@@ yp@@ e i didn &apos;t just choose one , here are little movies , sort of fu@@ zz@@ y , but you see that on the left are the mal@@ ig@@ nant cells , all of them are mal@@ ig@@ nant , we add one single in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or in the beginning , and look what happens , they all look like that .
so she , being an ima@@ ger and a physi@@ c@@ ist , did this incredible thing .
now if you take the mam@@ mary gl@@ and and spread it and take the fat away , on a dis@@ h it looks like that .
a single honest man , and he died without finding one back in gre@@ e@@ ce . and we have con@@ fu@@ ci@@ us in the east who was really concerned with sin@@ cer@@ ity , not only that you walked the walk or talked the talk , but that you believed in what you were doing .
but they &apos;re very special . they use ambi@@ gu@@ ity that comes from using technology . you don &apos;t know where i am or what i &apos;m doing or who i &apos;m with .
those are the conver@@ sa@@ tions that really matter .
along the y-@@ axis , the ver@@ tical axis , is how t@@ all they actually were .
we lie to protect ourselves or for our own gain or for somebody else &apos;s gain .
now , your task now is to decide which re@@ view is fa@@ ke ?
now , as i said , as a social scientist , this is wonderful .
who@@ a ! look at that sna@@ ke !
and also we wanted to free up the e@@ ars , so the sound actually goes through , condu@@ cts straight to the b@@ ones in your cr@@ ani@@ um , which is a little bit fre@@ ak@@ y at first , but you get used to it .
yeah , i &apos;ve really enjo@@ yed actually explor@@ ing the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video .
and i saw this really smart cri@@ tic who i love .
and i had this really interesting t@@ aro@@ t reading a long time ago .
and you know , i don &apos;t say that i do everything well , i just say that i do a lot of things , that &apos;s all .
it &apos;s just that .
do you get nervous , as@@ hl@@ ei@@ gh ?
im : are you fre@@ a@@ king out ? you look so c@@ ute .
and again , i don &apos;t say it &apos;s good , i just think it &apos;s not bor@@ ing , right ?
if you &apos;ve ever over@@ be@@ aten your whi@@ pped cre@@ am , it &apos;s actually bu@@ tter@@ milk .
in the age of glob@@ alization , we moved on .
we felt that they were out of date .
and i &apos;ll give you an example here at this stage .
however , if i ask your minds to focus currently on pakistan , and i ask you to think of the sym@@ b@@ ols and the leaders for democracy in pakistan today , you &apos;ll be hard pres@@ sed to think beyond perhaps the as@@ s@@ as@@ sin@@ ation of ben@@ a@@ zi@@ r b@@ hu@@ t@@ to .
what i mean by that is , if the world super@@ power today was a commun@@ ist , it would be much easier for democracy activi@@ sts to use democracy ac@@ ti@@ vis@@ m as a form of resi@@ stance against col@@ oni@@ alism , than it is today with the world super@@ power being america , occu@@ p@@ ying certain lands and also es@@ po@@ using democratic ide@@ als .
whereas if we start building this demand on the ground on a civili@@ za@@ tional level , rather than mer@@ ely on a political level , a level above politics -- movements that are not political par@@ ties , but are rather creating this civili@@ za@@ tional demand for this democratic culture .
i want to talk about the trans@@ formed media landscape , and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world .
and finally , about 100 years ago , the har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing of electro@@ magnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television .
we &apos;ve had the internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it &apos;s still changing as the media becomes more social .
this was an incredible , co@@ ordin@@ ated global response .
on the 20th an@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ary of ti@@ an@@ an@@ men they just , two days ago , announ@@ ced that they were simply shu@@ tting down access to twitter , because there was no way to filter it other than that .
and one of the things obama did , was they fam@@ ously , the obama campaign did , was they fam@@ ously put up my@@ bar@@ ack@@ ob@@ ama@@ .com , my@@ bo@@ .com and millions of citizens rus@@ hed in to participa@@ te , and to try and figure out how to help .
and the choice we face , i mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world , isn &apos;t whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in .
ok , this is the rou@@ te up ever@@ est .
that &apos;s another cre@@ vas@@ se .
this is not good weather to clim@@ b in , so the clim@@ bers are just waiting , hop@@ ing that the wind &apos;s going to die down .
so each person clim@@ bs individu@@ ally .
but in fact , what they said was , &quot; leave dou@@ g and come down yourself .
he was carrying a radio .
first , it turns white , and then when it &apos;s comple@@ ted ne@@ cro@@ sis , it turns black , and then it falls off .
this is a roughly normal scan , showing equal distribution of energy .
and you can see here , he &apos;s starting to get more energy into the fron@@ tal lo@@ be .
these are ti@@ bet@@ an pra@@ yer fla@@ gs .
today we talk of people as an as@@ set .
and the fact that we have english is now becoming a huge strate@@ gic as@@ set .
and really there are four things here .
and i think now you &apos;re seeing the move towards impro@@ ving our cities .
the third thing is our higher education .
but if india gro@@ ws at something like eight percent , income per year per person will go to 16 times by 20@@ 50 .
i &apos;m afraid i &apos;m one of those speak@@ ers you hope you &apos;re not going to meet at ted .
on one level nobody &apos;s questi@@ oning that democracy is the best form of government .
and you have the internet .
and when we talk about the internet , yes , it &apos;s true , the internet connected all of us , but we also know that the internet created these ech@@ o cham@@ bers and political g@@ he@@ t@@ to@@ s in which for all your life you can stay with the political community you bel@@ ong to .
it &apos;s not going to be the big brother watching you , it &apos;s going to be we being the big brother watching the political class .
now how many previous offen@@ ses do you think they have on average managed to com@@ mit ?
so in mar@@ ch 2010 , we sig@@ ned the first social impact bon@@ d with the mini@@ stry of justice around pe@@ ter@@ bor@@ ough prison .
so we set up a program with es@@ sex coun@@ ty coun@@ cil to test out inten@@ sive family ther@@ a@@ pe@@ u@@ tic support for those families with ad@@ oles@@ cents on the edge of the care system .
actually , for creating social change , we need to bring in the exper@@ ti@@ se in order to make this work .
&quot; they know . &quot;
every country is different and it &apos;s conf@@ using , okay ?
one guy wrote another guy . he said , &quot; i never knew these people laugh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; &#91; im@@ it@@ ating arab@@ ic &#93; -- tu@@ tt@@ i fru@@ tt@@ i ! &quot;
so ladies and gentle@@ men , i would like to take you on a journey throughout the contin@@ ents and throughout sound itself .
it is un@@ belie@@ v@@ ably bad .
the exciting thing is , look at the faces of the people .
wait ti@@ ll you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we &apos;ve invented .
okay , so let &apos;s talk a little bit about ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und , the force of ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und .
it is appro@@ ved under an f@@ da@@ i@@ de at the university of virg@@ ini@@ a in char@@ lot@@ tes@@ ville using focused ul@@ tr@@ as@@ o@@ und to ab@@ late a point in his th@@ al@@ am@@ us .
it is not being used in regular diagno@@ stic ima@@ ging .
okay , so you can see here the spot .
he re@@ turned again to his daily r@@ out@@ ine on the farm .
but i have now a message to the ladies .
she &apos;s ro@@ ot@@ ing around , she fin@@ ds this one jac@@ ket by bal@@ en@@ ci@@ ag@@ a -- she lo@@ ves it .
this is vi@@ vi@@ en@@ ne west@@ wood . no !
when you look at cop@@ ies like this , you wonder : how do the lux@@ ury high-@@ end br@@ ands re@@ main in business ?
and stu@@ art wei@@ tz@@ man is a very successful sho@@ e designer .
now , some fashion designers will say , &quot; it &apos;s only in the united states that we don &apos;t have any respect .
same with automo@@ bil@@ es .
then it deser@@ ves protection .
this str@@ ange@@ -@@ looking plant is called the ll@@ ar@@ et@@ a .
but lu@@ ck@@ ily , it worked out obviously , but it was a hum@@ bling experience to feel so dis@@ connected .
what looks like a forest is actually only one tree .
i had the opportunity to travel around the lim@@ po@@ p@@ o pro@@ vin@@ ce in south africa with an exper@@ t in ba@@ ob@@ ab trees .
this is the c@@ lon@@ al cre@@ o@@ so@@ te bush , which is around 12@@ ,000 years old .
it &apos;s my hope that , by going to find these organisms , that i can help draw attention to their remarkable resili@@ ence and help play a part in in@@ sur@@ ing their continu@@ ed lon@@ ge@@ vi@@ ty into the for@@ es@@ ee@@ able future .
let &apos;s set it to something else .
i started obser@@ ving technology and how crimin@@ als were using it as a young pat@@ ro@@ l off@@ ic@@ er .
they also monit@@ ored the internet and social media to monit@@ or the progress of their attac@@ ks and how many people they had killed .
ten people brought 20 million people to a stand@@ still , and this travel@@ ed around the world .
when they s@@ warm and ch@@ ase you down the block to sho@@ ot you , a little bit less so .
this is the future that a@@ wa@@ its us .
that has significant impli@@ cations for us .
what happens if we were to take the president &apos;s dna , or a king or queen &apos;s , and put it out to a group of a few hundred tru@@ sted researchers so they could study that dna and do pen@@ et@@ ration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders ?
mar@@ c go@@ od@@ man : a vision of cri@@ mes in the future
but the real question is , what is the cost of not dar@@ ing ?
because they &apos;re focused on hon@@ or@@ ing what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future .
ale@@ x , in some ways , said it best .
but less than 24 hours , i was 13 miles away from those mo@@ squ@@ es , vis@@ iting one of our ac@@ u@@ men inv@@ e@@ ste@@ es , an incredible man , ja@@ wa@@ d as@@ la@@ m , who dar@@ es to live a life of immer@@ sion .
and he said that every day this si@@ x-@@ year-old , d@@ ressed in her beautiful d@@ ress , would walk with real gra@@ ce through a p@@ hal@@ an@@ x of white people scre@@ aming ang@@ ri@@ ly , calling her a mon@@ ster , thre@@ at@@ ening to po@@ ison her -- di@@ stor@@ ted faces .
so may each of you live lives of immer@@ sion .
there are about 120 , you see them here .
and as you see here from the years that they were created , it is indeed the case .
my wife repli@@ ed , &quot; none of your business . &quot;
then i made a san@@ it@@ ary pad and hand@@ ed it to sh@@ ant@@ i -- my wife &apos;s name is sh@@ ant@@ i .
why is this ? i used medical college girls .
that is my idea .
ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al@@ am mur@@ u@@ gan@@ anth@@ am : how i started a san@@ it@@ ary nap@@ k@@ in revolution !
i have seen pol@@ ar be@@ ars walking across very , very thin ice in search of food .
i had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end .
and i remember standing underneath the hot sho@@ wer and trying to de@@ fro@@ st my fing@@ ers .
and i realize the reason why you &apos;re going to do this .
am@@ und@@ son , you ready ? am@@ u@@ d@@ son : ready .
i &apos;ve just come back from giving a series of spee@@ ches in some of the poor@@ est to@@ w@@ n@@ ships in south africa to young children as young as 10 years old .
oh , by the way , if you think you &apos;re very far from some of this oil , 1@@ 000 meters below where you &apos;re all sitting is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world .
what is the future of truly sustainable , carb@@ on-@@ free energy ?
all the same , what &apos;s different ?
and so what i &apos;m going to do is , not so much give you the great hits of that program , as to give you this whole notion of how you en@@ coun@@ ter people in that kind of situation , what you try to find out about them , and when people deliver and when they don &apos;t and why .
but i wanted intervie@@ ws that were different .
and it had nothing to do with the energy of being young .
all of us are public and private beings , and if all you &apos;re going to get from the intervie@@ we@@ e is their public self , there &apos;s no point in it .
and i was dying . she was absolutely not giving me a thing .
the public self , the beauty , the intelle@@ ct , and she walked around and talked to every person there and then went back into the room and was never seen again .
du@@ mas mal@@ one was from miss@@ is@@ si@@ pp@@ i origin@@ ally .
and she was lo@@ ving the pro@@ spe@@ ct of death as much as she had loved life .
so in the world of product design , the beautiful baby &apos;s like the concept car .
so recogni@@ tion is fantastic .
this is an american foundation that distribu@@ tes that technology to poor hospit@@ als around that region .
mom &apos;s vis@@ iting her kid .
so from the very beginning we started by talking to manufac@@ tur@@ ers .
we have to ask ourselves hard questions .
and in these don@@ or meetings , i noticed that many of the worst projects -- which were put forward by our cli@@ ents , by the governments , by pro@@ mot@@ ers , many of them repres@@ enting supp@@ li@@ ers from the north -- that the worst projects were realized first .
we will lose to the french , we will lose to the swe@@ des , we &apos;ll lose to the japanese . &quot;
we had a lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term time perspective .
so , we must be aware that civil society has to shape up itself .
if you go into a department store to buy a shir@@ t , are you going to try on every single shir@@ t and want every single shir@@ t ?
always before i &apos;d thought of it as a portra@@ it of a girl .
well , he com@@ part@@ ment@@ ali@@ zes his life .
he &apos;s an 18@@ th-@@ century french pain@@ ter best known for his still li@@ f@@ es , but he did occasi@@ on@@ ally paint people .
they can &apos;t hang it on the wall , because they don &apos;t know who he is .
perhaps that was the inten@@ tion .
george dra@@ ined another glass of c@@ lar@@ et and turned to me .
and so i think i have to tell you just a few words , a few things about my personal life , because i think there is a connection .
we thought this was a good story .
p@@ p : i keep trying to explain to people , it &apos;s not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming .
see you . b@@ ye .
you know , this is n@@ ollywood , where the magic lives .
but i really think this is a phenomenon that can inspi@@ re us .
we have diver@@ se cultures , diver@@ se cultures , there are so many , that in the nat@@ al life@@ times , i don &apos;t see us ex@@ hau@@ sting the stories we have .
it &apos;s a c@@ d , it &apos;s a little bit more comp@@ ressed image .
but more recently , i &apos;ve been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotion@@ ally really sugge@@ sti@@ ve and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost un@@ den@@ i@@ able .
&quot; that mis@@ ses the point . &quot;
we live today , as you know very well , not in the digital , not in the physical , but in the kind of min@@ e@@ str@@ one that our mind makes of the two .
so you start seeing here that the a@@ es@@ the@@ tics that are so important to a museum colle@@ ction like mom@@ a &apos;s are kept alive also by the sele@@ ction of these games .
but that &apos;s what would en@@ able us to preser@@ ve the video games for a really long time , and that &apos;s what muse@@ ums do .
i would like to do the same with video games .
can you turn off the light ? down .
so , nobody would like this .
it was pretty hard .
and the next night , we had ge@@ fil@@ te fish .
and i &apos;m fascin@@ ated with that , which , like the paper fur@@ ni@@ ture -- it &apos;s one of those materials .
the whole thing about my house , the whole use of r@@ ough car@@ p@@ ent@@ ry and everything , was the fru@@ stration with the cra@@ f@@ ts available .
and when i was awar@@ ded the contra@@ ct i , at the very beginning , asked the cli@@ ent if they would let stan@@ ley do a cam@@ e@@ o piece with me .
in bar@@ cel@@ on@@ a , on las ra@@ m@@ bl@@ as for some film festi@@ val , i did the hollywood sign going and coming , made a building out of it , and they built it .
the ow@@ ners had a dile@@ m@@ ma -- they asked phili@@ p to do it .
and this is our building , which is a corpo@@ rate head@@ quar@@ ters for an in@@ sur@@ ance company .
and it &apos;s very private .
this is for michael eis@@ ner -- dis@@ ney .
i was trying to get around this plan cou@@ pe -- how do you do it ?
this is eur@@ o dis@@ ney , and i &apos;ve worked with all of the guys that pres@@ ented to you earlier .
this is the dis@@ ney hall -- the conc@@ ert hall .
that &apos;s the idea .
origin@@ ally , this was all soli@@ d with a hole in it .
how is it that this can lead to over two million dea@@ ths every year ?
and in fact if you look closely , right here , you can see it says , &quot; u.s. peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
and more than in haiti , this produ@@ ces really smo@@ ky fir@@ es , and this is where you see the health im@@ pac@@ ts of cooking with co@@ w dung and bio@@ mass as a fuel .
but now we have a way one of the really exciting things , though , is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month .
if this were afghanistan , only one person in this room would know how the use the internet .
and we &apos;re a pretty small staf@@ f , which is me .
and imagine if he had hair spr@@ ou@@ ting from the middle of his nose , he &apos;d look even od@@ der still .
the adults be@@ have more naturally , and the children play more re@@ adi@@ ly with other children .
they were all percei@@ ved as being less than normal in all those characteri@@ stics -- more violent , etc . -- before the surgery .
and again , he said , &quot; this painting of me with my son jer@@ e@@ mi@@ ah shows me as the successful man that i feel that i am . &quot;
mu@@ z@@ et@@ ta &apos;s family give the lie to this .
so we &apos;ve talked a lot about fac@@ ial appe@@ ar@@ ance .
the face transp@@ l@@ ant has a role probably in bur@@ ns patients to replace the skin .
and we &apos;ve set up ch@@ ari@@ ties that will help us fund the clinical research to deter@@ mine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future , so we don &apos;t just sit on our lau@@ rel@@ s and say , &quot; okay , we &apos;re doing okay .
these are -- 10 companies control much of what &apos;s in our gro@@ cer@@ y stor@@ es , much of what people eat . and that &apos;s really , really a problem .
we cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .
because ei@@ ght-@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds don &apos;t get to decide -- and if they do , you should be in therapy .
in case you can &apos;t tell , that &apos;s , like , p@@ ink dan@@ ish and some kind of cu@@ p@@ c@@ ak@@ es .
you &apos;re not going to get the next generation , or the generation after , to be able to think like this if they &apos;re not n@@ our@@ ished .
where is soci@@ alization ? where is discussion ?
of course , it &apos;s not all about food ; it &apos;s also about kids getting exercise .
that number probably needs to double .
whether you sit down and eat a me@@ al with your kids , whether you take your kids , or grand@@ children , or nie@@ ces and ne@@ p@@ he@@ ws sh@@ opp@@ ing to a farmers &apos; market . just do ta@@ st@@ ings with them .
i &apos;m just kid@@ ding .
but they don &apos;t consider themselves experts on video games ; they &apos;ve just got strong opini@@ ons .
somehow , we have to explain how when you put together teams , ar@@ mi@@ es , bat@@ tali@@ ons of hundreds of millions of little robo@@ tic un@@ conscious cells -- not so different really from a bacteri@@ um , each one of them -- the result is this . i mean , just look at it .
&quot; he mer@@ ely makes you think that he does . &quot;
he didn &apos;t mention the speed . your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , no@@ ses , el@@ bo@@ ws , looking at interesting things in the world .
when an ar@@ t@@ ful blo@@ b of paint or two , by an artist , suggests a person -- say , one of mar@@ v@@ in min@@ sky &apos;s little society of mind -- do they send little pa@@ inter@@ s out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere ?
this is a figure that i love : bra@@ d@@ ley , pe@@ trie , and du@@ ma@@ is .
but ro@@ b van li@@ er has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
there are a few more really dra@@ matic ones , and then i &apos;ll close .
hi . i &apos;m here to talk about con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on , nam@@ ely road con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on .
when you try to solve really complex social problems , the right thing to do is most of the time to create the in@@ centi@@ ves .
well , the thing is that , the con@@ ge@@ sti@@ on char@@ ges , they were introduced first as a trial , so they were introduced in janu@@ ary and then abo@@ li@@ shed again at the end of ju@@ ly , followed by a refer@@ end@@ um , and then they were rein@@ tro@@ duced again in 2007 , which of course was a wonderful scientific opportunity .
they &apos;re not even aware of this themselves .
one day , i cros@@ sed the bridge over the ox@@ us river .
mon@@ i@@ ka bu@@ la@@ j : the hidden light of afghanistan
three days of fun and music .
he said , &quot; your shoul@@ der &apos;s going to be fine , but da@@ ve , there &apos;s something in your lung . &quot;
i went home .
i had one . my leg eventually sna@@ pped .
govern@@ ment@@ -@@ appro@@ ved , american cancer society , but patients know what patients want to know .
one of the things that she discovered was that her husband &apos;s medical record in this paper fol@@ der was just dis@@ organized .
what did google come out with this year ?
how big a deal was this ?
we take the water from the sea and we apply pressure .
so , magni@@ fi@@ cent cre@@ ature , isn &apos;t it ?
however , there are a group that do not use ech@@ olo@@ c@@ ation .
they &apos;re going to -- they are very thre@@ at@@ en@@ ed in the united states of america alone .
so in my lab , we &apos;ve been using bat@@ s to look at two different types of diseases of the senses .
think of a mouse . but bat@@ s are very different .
that &apos;s the alli@@ ance that changes the world .
after the war , you te@@ ar that up , you put 100,000 tro@@ ops in europe for over 40 years .
will it be taken ?
it &apos;s countries like nigeria , which are worse off than if they &apos;d never had oil .
people wanted to know what their government was getting in terms of re@@ venue .
i realized that the reason they &apos;re not there is that until we have a critical mass of in@@ formed citizens in our own societies , politicians will get away with gest@@ ures .
but if you have to have an operation , what you really want is a minim@@ ally invasi@@ ve operation .
now the science behind this is so po@@ tent that it became requi@@ red by the american board of surgery in order for a young surge@@ on to become board cer@@ ti@@ fied .
if you think about the worldwide bur@@ den of trying to talk to your patients -- not just teaching surge@@ ons , just trying to talk to your patients -- there aren &apos;t enough trans@@ lat@@ ors in the world .
i need to have a health care le@@ xic@@ on .
grab the need@@ le at the ti@@ p .
i had to do something .
i found a brilliant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engineer who designs sa@@ ils for america &apos;s c@@ up ra@@ cing y@@ ach@@ ts named peter he@@ p@@ pel .
i couldn &apos;t build this with a steel ring , the way i knew .
and i worked in min@@ es . and i realized that this was a world un@@ seen .
in stun@@ ning lar@@ ge-@@ form@@ at photographs , ed@@ ward bur@@ ty@@ n@@ sky follo@@ ws the path of oil through modern society , from well@@ head to pi@@ p@@ eline to car engine -- and then beyond to the proje@@ cted pe@@ ak@@ -@@ oil end@@ game .
there have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therap@@ ist &apos;s cou@@ ch , p@@ ills and the kni@@ fe .
neuro@@ scientist and inv@@ ent@@ or christ@@ op@@ her de@@ char@@ ms demon@@ str@@ ates a new way to use f@@ m@@ ri to show brain activity -- thoughts , emotions , pain -- while it is happening . in other words , you can actually see how you feel .
and we know -- we know -- that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
and just ad@@ mit@@ ting this -- just ad@@ mit@@ ting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans fl@@ our@@ ish -- will change the way we talk about mor@@ ality , and will change our expec@@ tations of human co@@ operation in the future .
there is clearly a range of materials that const@@ it@@ ute healthy food .
now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
on the left you have ed@@ ward wi@@ tten .
we live in a world filled with de@@ struc@@ tive technology , and this technology cannot be un@@ invented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
do people love their dau@@ gh@@ ters just as much in these systems ?
just open it .
fe@@ males giving rise to fe@@ males giving rise to other fe@@ males .
by the way , all these weird names -- i didn &apos;t bo@@ ther you with the la@@ tin names of these creatures , okay , just the popular names .
one gra@@ m &apos;s 8@@ 0,000 individuals , 8@@ 0,000 individuals are good enough to control one ac@@ re , 4@@ ,000 square meters , of a stra@@ w@@ ber@@ ry p@@ lot against spi@@ der mit@@ es for the whole seas@@ on of almost one year .
public demand -- the more the public dem@@ ands the redu@@ ction of chemicals , the more gro@@ wers become aware of the fact they should , wher@@ ever they can and wher@@ ever possible , replace the chemical control with biological control .
this is a scot@@ tish ca@@ st@@ le where people are playing golf in@@ do@@ ors , and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of su@@ its of ar@@ mor -- which you can &apos;t see there .
the auto@@ -@@ gy@@ r@@ o couldn &apos;t wait for the invention of the heli@@ cop@@ ter , but it should have -- it wasn &apos;t a big success .
and fau@@ x-@@ no@@ stal@@ gi@@ a works even in serious subje@@ cts like war .
this was the new york bi@@ ke m@@ essen@@ ger meeting the tour de fr@@ ance .
how can we understand what makes some societies more fra@@ gi@@ le than other societies ? the problem is obviously relevant to our situation today , because today as well , there are some societies that have already collap@@ sed , such as som@@ alia and r@@ wand@@ a and the former y@@ u@@ go@@ sla@@ via . there are also societies today that may be close to collap@@ se , such as ne@@ p@@ al , in@@ don@@ es@@ ia and colum@@ bia .
long-@@ held de@@ vo@@ tion to log@@ ging and to min@@ es and to agriculture , and to no government regu@@ lation ; values that worked well in the past , but they don &apos;t seem to be working well today .
one of the things that en@@ ab@@ led australia to survive in this remote out@@ post of european civilization for 250 years has been their british identity .
there &apos;s six million species of insects on this planet , six million species .
and here you see me in a small , pro@@ vin@@ cial town in china , li@@ ji@@ ang -- about two million in@@ habit@@ ants .
the su@@ ri@@ m@@ i sti@@ cks &#91; of &#93; cr@@ ab@@ meat , or is being sold as cra@@ b meat , is white fish that &apos;s being dy@@ ed with co@@ chin@@ e@@ al .
and of course , we are not there to say that &apos;s only for us , it &apos;s not for them .
and there &apos;s the environment .
on the le@@ ft@@ -@@ hand side , you see a market in la@@ os where they have ab@@ und@@ antly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
and they &apos;re being made in the most wonderful ways .
i mean i &apos;m nervous enough as it is .
you know , it &apos;s such a long wait that i actually started to even think about it in terms of te@@ ds .
they were des@@ per@@ ate for volunte@@ ers because the average age of the volunte@@ er at the hospital gift shop was 75 .
and what i &apos;d like to argue is that that &apos;s not necessarily the case , as progress is simply a word for change , and with change you gain something , but you also lose something .
imagine that that earth is at the center of the universe , and surro@@ unding it is the sky proje@@ cted onto a sphere .
and it &apos;s worth probably about three ma@@ c@@ book pro@@ s .
the way little le@@ wi@@ s would tell the time is by a picture of the sky .
this is one from oxford .
but have you seen anything in nature , an animal that has three legs ?
the one in front , the smaller , is stri@@ der ii .
it affec@@ ts the diam@@ e@@ ter and then can turn to the left , turn to the right .
now , we don &apos;t have enough time to go into technical details , i &apos;ll just show you some of the experiments .
and this student , probably the first time using it , but she can artic@@ u@@ late it many different ways .
i don &apos;t know how many of you have heard about robo@@ c@@ up .
how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
how do we develop these kinds of ideas ?
also , it &apos;s not about that , only about that . you also have to work really , really hard .
it &apos;s down@@ to@@ w@@ ns becoming g@@ ho@@ st to@@ w@@ ns .
there &apos;s basically no pool of quali@@ fied teachers to pull from , and only eight percent of the people in the coun@@ ty have a b@@ ach@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree or higher .
but beyond our personal reasons for wan@@ ting to be there , there is a huge need .
and in match me , you take the class , divi@@ de it into two teams , one team on each side of the play@@ ground , and the teacher will take a piece of ch@@ al@@ k and just write a number on each of the ti@@ r@@ es .
and what design off@@ ers as an edu@@ cational frame@@ work is an anti@@ do@@ te to all of the bor@@ ing , ri@@ gi@@ d , verb@@ al instru@@ ction that so many of these school distri@@ cts are pla@@ gu@@ ed by .
so for him , studio h off@@ ers him a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect , everything from dra@@ f@@ ting to wood and metal construction to how to do research for a cli@@ ent .
now there &apos;s no question about it at all : we will only solve the problem of re@@ plac@@ ing fossil fu@@ els with technology .
now we know that deser@@ ti@@ fication is caused by li@@ ve@@ stock , mostly c@@ attle , she@@ ep and go@@ ats , over@@ gra@@ zing the plants , leaving the soil bare and giving off me@@ than@@ e .
we have never understood it .
there is only one option , i &apos;ll repe@@ at to you , only one option left to cli@@ mat@@ ologists and scientists , and that is to do the un@@ thin@@ k@@ able , and to use li@@ ve@@ stock , bun@@ ched and moving , as a pro@@ x@@ y for former her@@ ds and pre@@ dat@@ ors , and mi@@ mic nature .
but before we began , our land looked like that .
thank you , chris .
that &apos;s my son , dar@@ i@@ us .
it has a very well-@@ equi@@ pped pe@@ di@@ atri@@ c op@@ h@@ th@@ al@@ mic center , which was made possible in part by a gift from the r@@ on@@ ald mc@@ don@@ ald char@@ ity .
after treatment , about every week , we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line .
it &apos;s a profound question , and what &apos;s even more amazing is how simple the answer is .
so , i thought , could we have dar@@ i@@ us serve as our bab@@ y@@ c@@ am car@@ rier , and that way get the in@@ puts that we feed into dy@@ lan ?
instead of anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating , the child always follo@@ ws where the ball has been .
i played soft@@ ball for five years growing up .
&quot; can i just sit in and see what you do ? &quot;
and at about 85 meters of my 100 meters spr@@ int , in all my gl@@ ory , i came out of my leg .
so , it &apos;s funny -- i &apos;m three in@@ ches within the world record -- and kept on from that point , you know , so i &apos;m sig@@ ned up in the long jump -- sig@@ ned up ?
i was losing , but it was the best training because this was atlan@@ ta .
ss : you know , show us more than one set of legs .
am : i don &apos;t know . i don &apos;t think so .
it &apos;s like a bar@@ b@@ ie foot under this .
i &apos;m actually going back in a couple of weeks to get some impro@@ v@@ ements .
what we &apos;re looking at here is the insi@@ di@@ ous cost of ring@@ t@@ one pi@@ ra@@ cy .
basically , no one &apos;s very happy .
why is it such an important part of education as a sort of comp@@ ul@@ sor@@ y subject ?
there was only one way to do calcul@@ ating and that was by hand .
one thing i often ask about is ancient gre@@ ek and how this rel@@ ates .
so just because paper was invented before computers , it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean you get more to the bas@@ ics of the subject by using paper instead of a computer to teach mathematics .
you can make it a qu@@ arti@@ c equ@@ ation . make it kind of harder , calcul@@ at@@ ing-@@ wise .
and experience of harder problems -- being able to play with the math , interact with it , feel it .
how many years of protection do i need ?
sa@@ f@@ ely reach@@ ing the other side , i turned to the left , pus@@ hed the auto@@ -@@ butt@@ on for the audi@@ ble pe@@ de@@ stri@@ an signal , and wa@@ ited my turn .
so although i had every reason to be fe@@ ar@@ ful of what was ahead , and had no clu@@ e quite what was going to happen , i was alive .
some distri@@ cts and cities have their own smell , as do places and things around you , and if you &apos;re lucky , you can even follow your nose to that new bak@@ ery that you &apos;ve been looking for .
&quot; bl@@ ess you , man . &quot;
if you design a city with the blind in mind , there &apos;ll be jobs , lots of jobs .
i do not re@@ com@@ men@@ d this at all .
a friend of mine sent me something called a hi@@ p-@@ ho@@ p bi@@ ble , where the tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ third p@@ sal@@ m is ren@@ dered as , &quot; the l@@ ord is all that , &quot; as op@@ posed to what i knew it as , &quot; the l@@ ord is my she@@ pher@@ d . &quot;
this was one of the huge lessons of the year , is that i almost pre@@ ten@@ ded to be a better person , and i became a little bit of a better person .
how should we view the bi@@ ble ?
another lesson is that tho@@ u s@@ halt give thanks .
that &apos;s how they prin@@ ted them in the old bi@@ bles .
there &apos;s the phr@@ ase called caf@@ e@@ teri@@ a religion , and the fundament@@ alists will use it in a den@@ i@@ gr@@ ating way , and they &apos;ll say , &quot; oh , it &apos;s just caf@@ e@@ teri@@ a religion .
so it was a ne@@ c@@ essi@@ ty .
that &apos;s a digital stor@@ age in a physical con@@ tain@@ er .
are you blin@@ ding pas@@ s@@ ers by and mot@@ ori@@ sts on the free@@ ways ?
and , of course , it &apos;s not just about navi@@ gation , but about manipu@@ lation as well .
and we might want to look at these various images .
you see , co@@ w@@ boys and french far@@ ce people don &apos;t go well together , and the system knows that .
so , in your mind , five years time , someone can buy this as part of a standard computer interface ?
and two progra@@ mm@@ ers who read her blog held their hands up and said , &quot; we could do that , &quot; and in 7@@ 2 hours , they launched us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di .
we were cou@@ ch po@@ tat@@ o@@ es because that was the only opportunity given to us .
this is a graph from a paper by ur@@ i g@@ nee@@ zy and al@@ do ru@@ sti@@ chin@@ i , who set out to test , at the beginning of this decade , what they called &quot; de@@ terr@@ ence theory . &quot;
they were operating with social con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts rather than contra@@ c@@ tual ones .
what &apos;s going to make the difference here is what de@@ an kamen said , the inv@@ ent@@ or and entrepr@@ en@@ eu@@ r .
another half an hour after 12 days .
and so we allowed mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tion@@ als into india .
a massive , massive success : india , the world tt cham@@ pi@@ ons .
an opening cer@@ em@@ ony to match every other .
so , he played in hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , went , straight after the game , went from the sta@@ dium to hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad air@@ port , sat in a private corpo@@ rate je@@ t -- first re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing in por@@ tu@@ g@@ al , second re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing in brazil ; he was in west in@@ dies in time .
i &apos;m so happy that you &apos;re here because i think we can show that we can both be together and be friends , right ?
i@@ p@@ l became the biggest brand in india and , because our elec@@ tions , had to be moved to south africa , and we had to start the tour@@ nam@@ ent in three weeks .
it turns out that , in fact , the world was given this gift in 17@@ 3@@ 8 by a du@@ tch poly@@ math named dan@@ iel ber@@ n@@ ou@@ ll@@ i .
are there more four@@ -@@ letter english words with r in the third place or r in the first place ?
well , there are many answers , but one answer sur@@ ely is , we see a lot of w@@ inn@@ ers . right ? when this couple w@@ ins the lot@@ ter@@ y , or ed mc@@ ma@@ h@@ on shows up at your door with this giant check -- how the hell do you c@@ ash things that size , i don &apos;t know .
but in fact , to decide whether a big ma@@ c is worth 25 dollars requires that you ask one , and only one question , which is : what else can i do with 25 dollars ?
you also have a 20@@ -@@ dollar bill .
now , re@@ ta@@ il@@ ers knew this long before anybody else did , of course , and they use this wisdom to help you -- sp@@ are you the un@@ due bur@@ den of money .
but if you dro@@ ve across town , you could get it for 3@@ 0@@ ,@@ 9@@ 00 .
so let me give you one very easy problem , a second very easy problem and then a third , hard , problem .
however , the difference between them seems to be getting smaller .
that explains why we are so bad at using it , but it also explains why it is so terri@@ bly important that we become good , fast .
is it the fact that it &apos;s an inten@@ tional attack by , quote , out@@ si@@ ders ?
poverty , by an order of magni@@ tude , a huge order of magni@@ tude , unless someone can show that there &apos;s , you know , terrori@@ sts with a nu@@ ke are really likely to come .
d@@ g : well , no , it &apos;s a great point . it rema@@ ins to be seen whether the joy of anti@@ ci@@ pa@@ tion is exactly equ@@ aled by the amount of dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ t@@ ment after the lot@@ ter@@ y . because remember , people who didn &apos;t buy ti@@ ckets don &apos;t feel awful the next day either , even though they don &apos;t feel great during the drawing .
dan gil@@ bert pres@@ ents research and data from his explor@@ ation of happiness -- sharing some surprising tests and experiments that you can also try on yourself . watch through to the end for a spar@@ kl@@ ing q &amp; amp ; a with some familiar faces .
and so the entire issue is de@@ to@@ xi@@ fied by the use of &quot; du@@ t@@ ch@@ man . &quot;
and i was going to do a thing , i say , &quot; well , change the copy .
and then more self-@@ questi@@ oning -- &quot; am i being simp@@ le-@@ min@@ ded ?
and another piece for the art direc@@ tors &apos; club is &quot; an@@ na re@@ es &quot; ca@@ sting long sha@@ dows .
in the 17@@ th century , a woman named gi@@ u@@ li@@ a to@@ fan@@ a had a very successful per@@ fu@@ me business .
&quot; in tier@@ r@@ o del fu@@ e@@ go a na@@ tive tou@@ ched with his finger some cold preser@@ ved meat while i was eating ...
you could probably see it in the audience members when i showed you those dis@@ gu@@ sting images .
in another set of studies we actually simply re@@ min@@ ded people -- this was at a time when the s@@ wine flu was going around -- we re@@ min@@ ded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to was@@ h their hands .
in a way , i feel like that .
and it particularly don &apos;t feed your spli@@ ff hab@@ it .
let &apos;s go .
what , of course , happens with that is violence , which we see when we talk about the g@@ he@@ t@@ to@@ s and we talk about , you know , south central l@@ .@@ a@@ . and this kind of stuff , and which eventually , when chan@@ nel@@ ed , becomes , you know , evol@@ ves and mani@@ fe@@ sts itself as ri@@ ots -- like the one in fr@@ ance two years ago , where i live , which sho@@ cked everybody , because everyone thought , &quot; oh well , fr@@ ance is a liber@@ al society . &quot;
i don &apos;t remember how we got there .
he &apos;s not taking care of his tro@@ ops .
war is a crime , yes , but i did not start it .
and consi@@ der@@ ing where you are coming from , and when we consider the ex@@ tent to which it &apos;s not taken as seriously as it should be , what would you have to say about that ?
and if you want to go back and read the book again , you just fold it back up and put it back on the page .
you can pin@@ ch into any page .
f@@ g : people on the street came and kno@@ cked on the door to see if i was okay .
i think it was circum@@ stan@@ tial .
they weren &apos;t mista@@ kes ; i saw everything that i would have changed and i was embar@@ ras@@ sed by it .
and so to find one , a guy like that , you hang on to him .
it must be like that for k@@ y@@ u doing things with musi@@ cians -- it &apos;s similar to that i would imagine -- where you ... hu@@ h ?
that was the surprise of going across the river , of going on the high@@ way around it , of walking down the street and finding it .
r@@ w : ... sort of had a f@@ ame . his f@@ ame was built on that in l@@ .@@ a@@ . for a while .
since bil@@ ba@@ o opened , which is now four , five years , both kr@@ ens and i have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- china , brazil , other parts of spa@@ in -- to come in and do the bil@@ ba@@ o effect .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , i &apos;m old enough that i can com@@ pla@@ in i can &apos;t travel .
but what i think it was telling me is that we are this transi@@ ent thing that &apos;s happening , and that the nature that you see out there -- the un@@ tou@@ ched shor@@ el@@ ines , the un@@ tou@@ ched forest that i was able to see -- really bring in a sense of that ge@@ ological time , that this has gone on for a long time , and we &apos;re experi@@ en@@ cing it in a different way .
and these ages of man are still at work today .
and that those oil t@@ ank@@ ers needed to be de@@ com@@ mis@@ sion@@ ed , and 2004 was going to be the p@@ inn@@ ac@@ le .
so i spent about three tri@@ ps to the three gor@@ ges dam , looking at that massive transformation of a landscape .
and there &apos;s about 1@@ 30 million people in mi@@ gration trying to get into urban centers at all times , and in the next 10 to 15 years , are expe@@ cting another 400 to 500 million people to mi@@ gra@@ te into the urban centers like sh@@ ang@@ hai and the manufacturing centers .
so the industry &apos;s already growing around these new develop@@ ments .
this is going to show you , real time , an assem@@ bl@@ er . it &apos;s a circu@@ it break@@ er .
it was very hard to get into the international companies because i had to get per@@ mission from companies like ni@@ ke and adi@@ das , and that &apos;s very hard to get .
and it is a bit of a problem . the way they recy@@ cle the bo@@ ards is that they actually use the coal bri@@ qu@@ et@@ tes , which are used all through china , but they heat up the bo@@ ards , and with pa@@ irs of pli@@ ers they pull off all the components .
and it &apos;s looking at technology , and it &apos;s looking at new energ@@ y-@@ saving devices , and it &apos;s looking at how to re@@ think and how to re-@@ strategi@@ ze the movement towards sustain@@ ability .
the art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them and do them , but the actual things have to be ver@@ i@@ fi@@ able .
the entire pi@@ le is my stuff if i &apos;m building something .
in fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
this is just one example .
we have signific@@ antly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .
we push that material to ex@@ tru@@ ders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make sp@@ ag@@ he@@ t@@ ti@@ -@@ like plastic str@@ ands .
but of course , just in the last two years we see these un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented examples of human in@@ ep@@ titude .
and what we see is that people tend to keep making er@@ r@@ ors exactly the same way , over and over again .
we make a lot of mista@@ kes in a lot of different con@@ tex@@ ts .
it turns out not just may@@ day , all of our mon@@ keys get good at tra@@ ding to@@ ken@@ s with human sal@@ es@@ man .
so i &apos;ll show you a quick video of what this market@@ place actually looks like .
we were a little im@@ patient so we wanted to sort of speed things up a bit .
think about how you &apos;d feel sti@@ cking it in your wal@@ let .
that means when we &apos;re in a risk min@@ d@@ set -- exc@@ use me , when we &apos;re in a loss min@@ d@@ set , we actually become more ris@@ ky , which can actually be really wor@@ rying .
maybe we should see how they do with los@@ ses .
a little bad for mon@@ key inv@@ e@@ stors .
we &apos;re so good at over@@ coming our biological limit@@ ations -- you know , i fle@@ w over here in an airplane .
just like s@@ no@@ w@@ fla@@ kes , no two pieces of wood can ever be the same anywhere on earth .
that challenge means that we have to start thinking in new ways , and i think wood is going to be part of that solution , and i &apos;m going to tell you the story of why .
or , the last thing we want to do is cut down the wrong trees .
that ei@@ ff@@ el to@@ wer moment will break the cei@@ ling , these arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary cei@@ l@@ ings of hei@@ ght , and allow wood buildings to join the competition .
governments exist to chan@@ nel the flow of two things , really , values and exper@@ ti@@ se to and from government and to and from citizens to the end of making decisions .
why is twitter so successful ? because it op@@ ens up its platform .
so what is texas doing ? they &apos;re asking you and me , using online policy wi@@ k@@ is , to help not simply get rid of bur@@ den@@ some regu@@ lations that im@@ pe@@ de entreprene@@ ur@@ ship , but to replace those regu@@ lations with more innovative alterna@@ tives , sometimes using transpar@@ ency in the creation of new iphone app@@ s that will allows us both to protect consum@@ ers and the public and to encourage economic development .
the second phase is in getting decisi@@ on-@@ making power out .
and if someone happened to be missing , we would have to , we say , &quot; fix a pla@@ te &quot; for that person , put it in the o@@ ven , then we could say gra@@ ce , and we could eat .
we thought he must be out of his mind .
so , there &apos;s another picture . here , this one . i really do like this picture .
i developed a sense of compassion sort of as second nature , but i became a pre@@ a@@ cher .
i believe that whatever we did around that table at b@@ loo@@ d@@ worth street must be done around tables and ritu@@ als of faith until we become that family , that family together that under@@ stands the nature of our unity .
we &apos;ve been working on democra@@ ti@@ zing lincol@@ n center for a public that doesn &apos;t usually have $ 300 to spend on an oper@@ a ti@@ cket .
there should be a way of har@@ n@@ ess@@ ing all of that intellectual and global energy into , and somehow through , the museum .
but how could it take the space of that hole and not be bu@@ ried in it invisi@@ bly ?
this is the view from the inside .
but it can &apos;t be more li@@ t than the capit@@ ol or some of the mon@@ um@@ ents .
art and politics occu@@ p@@ y an ambi@@ gu@@ ous site outside the museum walls , but inside of the museum &apos;s core , bl@@ en@@ ding its air with the democratic air of the m@@ all .
my brothers and si@@ sters were sc@@ at@@ ter@@ ed .
so i hope you &apos;re going to hear this .
i carry the ban@@ ner of the trau@@ ma .
what energi@@ zed me and kept me going is the music i do .
here i am in the west . i choose not to .
invest in education .
big scre@@ am for em@@ ma everybody .
it begins with the mur@@ der of an inno@@ cent human being , and it &apos;s followed by a trial where the mur@@ derer is con@@ vi@@ cted and sent to death row , and that death sentence is ultimately u@@ ph@@ el@@ d by the state app@@ ell@@ ate cour@@ t .
it hasn &apos;t happened because of a dis@@ solution of popular support for the death pen@@ al@@ ty . death pen@@ al@@ ty op@@ pon@@ ents take great sol@@ ace in the fact that death pen@@ al@@ ty support in texas is at an all@@ -@@ time low .
and he was learning how , when you have a big old g@@ n@@ arly problem , sometimes the solution is to sli@@ ce it into smaller problems .
instead , let me talk about a couple of mo@@ des of interven@@ tion that we can all help ac@@ compli@@ sh , because they are mo@@ des of interven@@ tion that will come about when leg@@ is@@ lat@@ ors and poli@@ cy@@ makers , when tax@@ pa@@ yers and citizens , agree that that &apos;s what we ought to be doing and that &apos;s how we ought to be spending our money .
there was nothing left to do in his case .
sister mary kev@@ in had been band@@ ying it about my secon@@ d-@@ grade class at school . but when she said it , the phr@@ ase seemed all caught up in the exc@@ it@@ ement of prepar@@ ations for our first comm@@ union and our first conf@@ ession , and everybody knew that was really all about the white d@@ ress and the white v@@ eil , and anyway , i hadn &apos;t really paid all that much attention to that phr@@ ase , &quot; age of reason . &quot;
so , to find out that there was no s@@ ant@@ a cl@@ aus at all was actually sort of a re@@ lief .
this was around the time that i started fil@@ ling out physi@@ cally , and i was fil@@ ling out a lot more than a lot of the other girls , and , frank@@ ly , the whole idea that my astro@@ logi@@ cal sign was a scale just seemed om@@ in@@ ous and depres@@ sing .
and god came to le@@ hi and said to him , &quot; put your family on a boat and i will lead you out of here . &quot; and god did lead them .
women &apos;s longer li@@ fes@@ pan ? the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men ? but , no , it wasn &apos;t any of these gif@@ ts .
juli@@ a swe@@ en@@ ey : le@@ tting go of god
come on . in the western world , we have enough .
why are statisti@@ cians not meas@@ uring these ?
now , there &apos;s a huge ar@@ ray of nations around that global average .
their government is one of the first to com@@ mit to be carbon neu@@ tra@@ l by 20@@ 21 .
that is changing our business .
and we need positive feedback lo@@ ops for increasing well-@@ being at a government level , they might create national accoun@@ ts of well-@@ being .
it &apos;s more curi@@ osity .
statisti@@ cian ni@@ c mar@@ ks as@@ ks why we measure a nation &apos;s success by its produ@@ c@@ tivity -- instead of by the happiness and well-@@ being of its people . he introdu@@ ces the happy planet inde@@ x , which tra@@ cks national well-@@ being against resource use . which countries r@@ ank highest in the h@@ p@@ i ? you might be surprised .
i was doing my ta@@ xes the other day , and i got to the point where i was li@@ sting all of the don@@ ations i gave , and i had an epi@@ ph@@ any , it was -- i came to my check to the se@@ va foundation and i noticed that i thought , boy , my friend lar@@ ry brilliant would really be happy that i gave money to se@@ va .
the sc@@ ari@@ est thing is that his i@@ q is 1@@ 60 : a cer@@ ti@@ fied geni@@ us .
they have it for people with aller@@ gi@@ es to pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts .
yes , breast cancer .
how do you keep che@@ er when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ?
my story is a story of over@@ coming se@@ t@@ bac@@ ks , ob@@ stac@@ les and challenges that life thro@@ ws at you .
i was fru@@ strated -- i was working as a software engineer in this huge , very exciting lab , lots of people coming from all over the world .
that &apos;s what it was like then .
he had put it together , combin@@ ed it into something more interesting than the original pieces and then he &apos;d put it into this software , which i think his son developed , origin@@ ally , and produ@@ ces this wonderful pres@@ entation .
it &apos;s not just a ro@@ ot sup@@ pl@@ ying a plant , but for each of those plants , whatever it is -- a pres@@ entation , an analysis , somebody &apos;s looking for patterns in the data -- they get to look at all the data and they get it connected together , and the really important thing about data is the more things you have to connect together , the more powerful it is .
i can use it in my company .
but a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment is on dat@@ ab@@ ases , often sitting in their computers , and actually , currently not shared .
before i came down here , i looked it up on open@@ stre@@ et@@ map the open@@ stre@@ et@@ map &apos;s a map , but it &apos;s also a wi@@ ki .
thanks .
should those be in the new pac@@ ka@@ ge of goals ?
long-term trends suggest that this century is going to be a tough place to live , with population incre@@ ases , consumption patterns increasing , and conflict over sc@@ ar@@ ce natural resources .
j@@ d : it does , and we &apos;re having a huge debate in this country about aid levels , for example , and aid alone is not the whole solution . nobody thinks it is .
then , when i was in ei@@ gh@@ th standard around 13 years old , i started working in a part@@ -@@ time job in one of the sign@@ board artists called pu@@ tu .
so i was working on the line , but instead of working about tra@@ ces , i started cap@@ turing tra@@ ces .
how many of you saw a co@@ w cros@@ sing in india while you were coming from bang@@ al@@ ore to my@@ sor@@ e ?
so what we conc@@ ei@@ ve as a meaning is always not there ; it &apos;s on the other side , even when we say dark , light , good , bad , t@@ all , short -- all meaning it doesn &apos;t exist in reality .
then i thought , &quot; i will go to the small scale industri@@ es facili@@ tat@@ ing unit and ask help . &quot;
&quot; of course not . for me , &quot; i &apos;m thinking , &quot; this is tu@@ cked in some small soli@@ d , but the moment it ev@@ a@@ por@@ ates , it &apos;s mer@@ ged with the whole . &quot;
the skin of this is also repres@@ enting this .
so my rec@@ our@@ se was like , is there any way to use all this as just a symbol or a sign ?
one particular thing we might look at , in terms of long-term flo@@ ws of people , is what percentage of the world &apos;s population is accoun@@ ted for by fir@@ st-@@ generation im@@ migr@@ ants ?
especially because , i sus@@ pe@@ ct , some of you may still be a little bit skep@@ tical of the cla@@ im@@ s , i think it &apos;s important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be pr@@ one to glob@@ al@@ on@@ ey .
non-@@ ne@@ gli@@ gi@@ ble , so we don &apos;t live in an entirely local or national world , but very , very far from the 95 percent level that you would expect , and the reason &apos;s very simple .
pan@@ ka@@ j g@@ he@@ ma@@ w@@ at : actually , the world isn &apos;t flat
so i work in marketing , which i love , but my first passion was physics , a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher , when i had a little less gra@@ y hair .
the act of obser@@ vation changes it .
so the physics is that you cannot prove a hypo@@ thesis , but it &apos;s easy to dis@@ prove it -- any hypo@@ thesis is sha@@ ky .
physics and marketing don &apos;t seem to have much in common , but dan co@@ b@@ ley is passionate about both . he brings these un@@ likely bed@@ fel@@ lo@@ ws together using new@@ ton &apos;s second law , hei@@ sen@@ berg &apos;s un@@ certain@@ ty principle , the scientific method and the second law of ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics to explain the fundamental theor@@ ies of br@@ anding .
car@@ ol@@ ine phil@@ li@@ ps : i didn &apos;t hear you . would you like to hear it ?
and it can &apos;t result in healthy sexu@@ ality developing in young people or in adults .
it starts with an intern@@ al sense , an intern@@ al desire , or a need .
there &apos;s a million different t@@ opp@@ ings .
you do . i do .
it &apos;s a little bit like when you are ma@@ dly in love with somebody and you walk into a par@@ king lot -- their car is different from every other car in the par@@ king lot .
and last but not least , it is an obs@@ ession .
but certainly , around the world , people who are re@@ je@@ cted in love will kill for it .
and , indeed , that car@@ a@@ van is moving on .
but even at men@@ stru@@ ation , they &apos;re better than the average man .
and what i really think that we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re moving towards a collabor@@ ative society , a society in which the tal@@ ents of both men and women are becoming understood and valu@@ ed and emplo@@ yed .
and as it turns out , the older you get , the less likely you are to di@@ vor@@ ce .
over 100 million pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions of anti@@ depres@@ san@@ ts are written every year in the united states .
and about a year ago , an internet dat@@ ing service , mat@@ ch@@ .com , came to me and asked me if i would design a new dat@@ ing site for them .
and , &quot; wasn &apos;t that ri@@ ck@@ sha@@ w driver hand@@ some ! &quot;
and we all know that &apos;s from eating too much and not exer@@ cis@@ ing enough , right ?
i did this and lost 40 pounds , wei@@ r@@ dly while exer@@ cis@@ ing less .
in fact , it &apos;s the opposite . it &apos;s a healthy response to the trau@@ ma , all of those imm@@ une cells rus@@ hing to the site of the in@@ j@@ ury to sal@@ v@@ age cell@@ ular de@@ br@@ is and prevent the spread of infe@@ ction to el@@ se@@ where in the body .
but that doesn &apos;t mean my bi@@ as is wrong , and most important , all of this can be te@@ sted scienti@@ fically .
sta@@ ying true to that path will be better for our patients and better for science .
i &apos;d jump behind the whe@@ el and take the new model around the dri@@ ve@@ way , and it was a bl@@ ast .
i jo@@ ined ford after college , after some sou@@ l se@@ arch@@ ing whether or not this is really the right thing to do .
when we look at the population growth in terms of cars , it becomes even clear@@ er .
we are going to build smart cars , but we also need to build smart roads , smart par@@ king , smart public transpor@@ tation systems and more .
so you get in your car , and as you get in your car , your car will reser@@ ve you a par@@ king spot before you arri@@ ve -- no more driving around looking for one , which frank@@ ly is one of the biggest users of fuel in today &apos;s cars in urban areas -- is looking for par@@ king spo@@ ts .
and it frank@@ ly will en@@ h@@ ance our quality of life if we fix this .
i think something happens . i think a head may appear in a second .
not particularly the world &apos;s best design solution for those of us who are real , sort of , har@@ d-@@ core designers , but non@@ eth@@ eless , a fab@@ ul@@ ous em@@ path@@ ic solution for people .
when we actually went and watched this proce@@ d@@ ure taking place -- and i &apos;ll explain this in a second -- it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this that they really weren &apos;t recogni@@ zing .
you can draw from this .
so what is this ? i hear you all ask . no , i don &apos;t .
so we actually managed to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le the needs of the design company , the needs of the individuals in the company , to feel good about a product we were actually designing , and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for .
and i was stru@@ ck by just how wonderful it felt , and how con@@ ta@@ gi@@ ous that feeling was .
now it was not about ri@@ ver@@ side school .
how ? we designed a simple to@@ ol@@ k@@ it , conver@@ ted it into eight languages , and reach@@ ed 3@@ 2,000 schools .
girl : thank you , ladies and gentle@@ men .
i think that -- i &apos;ve said in the past , many , many years ago , before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda , that it wasn &apos;t about fashion -- it was about survival .
this is going back the mid@@ - &apos; 5@@ 0s , &apos; 6@@ 0s .
of course you can &apos;t separate this out from issues like social diversity , mass trans@@ it , the ability to be able to walk a conven@@ i@@ ent distance , the quality of ci@@ vi@@ c spaces .
in 2001 , this building received an a@@ ward .
if i show another aspe@@ ct of that technology then , in a completely different context -- this a@@ partment building in the al@@ ps in swi@@ tz@@ er@@ land .
going back in time , there was a lady called val@@ er@@ ie lar@@ k@@ in , and in 198@@ 7 , she had all our information on one dis@@ k .
and finally , you profi@@ le this , you cut gro@@ o@@ ves into it .
it is physi@@ cally the largest project on the planet at the moment .
if we would apply these co@@ des and standards to the pan@@ the@@ on in ro@@ me , it would never have looked like this , because this beautiful light fe@@ ature can only appear because there is also dar@@ k@@ ness in that same building .
it has only on one side this big , big glass window that helps to let the sun@@ light enter deep into the space and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range .
you can see here a photo from the united states library of medicine , where people are put in the sun to get better .
the world is changing though , and ur@@ b@@ ani@@ zation is a big driver of everything .
and the phosp@@ h@@ or is excited by the blue and makes the light white and warm and pleas@@ ant .
in all of these examples , i think , we should start making the light out of dar@@ k@@ ness , and use the dar@@ k@@ ness as a can@@ v@@ as -- like the visual artists do , like ed@@ ward hop@@ per in this painting .
the point that we have been st@@ res@@ sing for the last 21 years , the point that people may be econom@@ ically poor , but they &apos;re not poor in the mind .
and this was a moment of great pain and trau@@ ma because i couldn &apos;t live with it any longer .
i &apos;m a professor ; i must qui@@ z you .
no machines have been developed .
we saw it in sho@@ dh y@@ at@@ ra . every six months we walk in different parts of the country .
so this fellow is bringing a fl@@ our@@ -@@ gr@@ in@@ ding machine on a two-@@ whe@@ el@@ er .
it has gone in your sto@@ mach . it was not meant for that .
now , the em@@ in@@ ent model , the long-@@ tail model tells you that small sal@@ es of a large number of books , for example , having only a few cop@@ ies sold can still be a vi@@ able model .
a@@ g : many of you might not realize and believe that we have sold this product internation@@ ally -- what i call a g@@ 2@@ g model , gras@@ s@@ roots to global .
re@@ move it , the c@@ art needs one don@@ key less .
thank you .
and it was an environmental impro@@ vement , because , for instance , in 19@@ 0@@ 3 they out@@ la@@ wed hor@@ ses and bu@@ g@@ gi@@ es in down@@ town manhattan , because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million hor@@ ses , and a million of them ur@@ in@@ ating and doing other things , and the typ@@ ho@@ id and other problems created were almost uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able .
i think there &apos;s -- i don &apos;t know what data would im@@ press you , but how about , 4@@ 3 percent of the re@@ fin@@ ed fuel produced in the world is consum@@ ed by cars in me@@ tro@@ poli@@ tan areas in the united states .
what if you could make them fun , attra@@ ctive , clean , environ@@ ment@@ ally friend@@ ly ?
so i get off , and she gets on , and with a little bit of the usual , ah , then she turns around , and she goes about 20 feet , and she turns back around , and she &apos;s all s@@ miles .
not much has changed .
and women shouldn &apos;t have to spend four hours a day looking for it , or watching their kids die .
this story of horri@@ fic violence followed by a f@@ um@@ bled approach by feder@@ al and local auth@@ ori@@ ties as they tried to engage civil society , who has been very well enga@@ ged by a crimin@@ al organization , is a perfect metaphor for what &apos;s happening in mexico today , where we see that our current understanding of drug violence and what leads to it is probably at the very least in@@ complete .
it &apos;s not only a multi-@@ billion dollar market , but it &apos;s also a complex one .
this kind of business model obviously depends entirely on having a very effective brand of fear , and so los z@@ et@@ as carefully stage acts of violence that are spec@@ tac@@ ular in nature , especially when they arri@@ ve first in a city , but again , that &apos;s just a brand strategy .
like any other mul@@ tin@@ a@@ tional would , they protect their brand by ou@@ ts@@ our@@ cing the more questi@@ on@@ able parts of the business model , like for example , when they have to engage in violence against other crimin@@ al organizations , they rec@@ ru@@ it gan@@ gs and other smaller players to do the dir@@ ty work for them , and they try to separate their oper@@ ations and their violence and be very dis@@ cre@@ te about this .
and it &apos;s interesting , when you look at the predic@@ tions made during the peak of the bo@@ om in the 199@@ 0s , about e-@@ commer@@ ce , or internet traffic , or broad@@ band ad@@ option , or internet adverti@@ sing , they were all right -- they were just wrong in time .
each one of those is an opportunity to do something about it ; it &apos;s an opportunity for the technology to change .
i &apos;d like to talk about some other technologies out there , just technologies on our ra@@ dar -- and i &apos;ll use this l@@ ens , these four , as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development .
but you can look and see the direction those lines are going , you can see that at the 20 percent , it &apos;s now taken seriously .
it &apos;s a de@@ fla@@ tion@@ ary force , if not hand@@ led right .
because of the resources , the skills , and certainly the sur@@ ge of talent we &apos;re seeing all around the world , with the min@@ d@@ set to create change .
it &apos;s money that &apos;s invest@@ ed in entreprene@@ urs who know their communities and are building solutions to health@@ care , water , h@@ ous@@ ing , alternative energy , thinking of low income people not as passi@@ ve reci@@ pi@@ ents of char@@ ity , but as individual custom@@ ers , consum@@ ers , cli@@ ents , people who want to make decisions in their own lives .
the dri@@ p ir@@ ri@@ gation system had to be small enough that a farmer only had to risk a quar@@ ter ac@@ re , even if he had two , because it was too fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing , given all that he had at sta@@ ke .
because we &apos;re starting to see these enter@@ pris@@ es reach hundreds of thousands of people . all of the ones i discus@@ sed have reach@@ ed at least a quar@@ ter million people .
and we left kar@@ ach@@ i one morning before da@@ wn .
i can only talk from my own experience , but in eight years of running ac@@ u@@ men fund , i &apos;ve seen the power of patient capital .
and because i wanted to im@@ press you all with sli@@ des , since i saw the great pres@@ ent@@ ations yesterday with graph@@ s , i made a graph that moves , and i talk about the ma@@ ke@@ up of me .
this was an illu@@ stration about my camp experience when i was 11 years old , and how i went to a y@@ m@@ ca camp -- chri@@ stian camp -- and basically by the end , i had made my friends hate me so much that i hi@@ d in a bun@@ k . they couldn &apos;t find me .
you could take that money and buy your ban@@ jo .
his father was a blog@@ ger .
and we talk about the world fl@@ atten@@ s as being this pan@@ el , and i am very optimi@@ stic .
another photo that has great@@ ly influ@@ enced me , or a series of photos , is this project that &apos;s done by an ar@@ gent@@ ine@@ an man and his wife .
that this woman is in england , and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing .
it was fis@@ hed sustain@@ ably ti@@ ll all of time , except for our generation .
and we &apos;ve got to use these technologies immediately to get a better understanding of how our ocean real@@ m works .
we &apos;d been studying these fish , but first we had to learn how to hus@@ band@@ ry them .
now sometimes the tun@@ as are really large , such as this fish off nan@@ tu@@ cket .
astronom@@ ically , we &apos;re calcul@@ ating posi@@ tions .
sal@@ mon sharks go down to the tro@@ pic@@ s to pu@@ p and come into mon@@ ter@@ ey .
and from this information , we can begin to map the hope spo@@ ts .
a lot of people are excited when sharks actually went under the gol@@ den gate bridge .
and when most of us get asked , &quot; where were you september 12@@ th ? &quot;
you &apos;re basically fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face with someone that essentially deci@@ des life or death .
with pictures , with travel ti@@ ps .
so these are the stor@@ es that i shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know .
so there &apos;s different categ@@ ori@@ zations of me@@ als e@@ aten outside empty train sta@@ tions , empty gas sta@@ tions .
and by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you , the information that the f@@ bi has has no value , so th@@ us de@@ valu@@ ing their cur@@ ren@@ cy .
and i &apos;m gla@@ d that we have pat@@ r@@ ons of the arts in these fields .
now , i mention squ@@ e@@ ak because se@@ ba@@ stian &apos;s first gu@@ est happened to see a rather large mouse run across the kitchen , and she promis@@ ed that she would re@@ fra@@ in from leaving a bad re@@ view on one condition : he got a cat .
because at its core , it &apos;s about em@@ power@@ ment .
now the tas@@ ks being po@@ sted are things that you might expect , like help with house@@ hold ch@@ or@@ es or doing some super@@ market runs .
the difference today is that , with every trade we make , com@@ ment we leave , person we fla@@ g , b@@ ad@@ ge we ear@@ n , we leave a repu@@ tation tra@@ il of how well we can and can &apos;t be tru@@ sted .
this isn &apos;t some far@@ -@@ off fron@@ tier .
when you talk to super@@ -@@ users , whether that &apos;s super@@ rab@@ bits or super@@ -@@ people on st@@ ack over@@ flow , or u@@ ber@@ ho@@ sts , they all talk about how having a high repu@@ tation un@@ lo@@ cks a sense of their own power .
these are small areas of england and wal@@ es -- the poor@@ est on the right , the rich@@ est on the left .
it con@@ tains whether kids can talk to their parents , whether they have books at home , what imm@@ uni@@ zation rates are like , whether there &apos;s bu@@ ll@@ ying at school .
this is mental illness .
there &apos;s more social mo@@ bility .
and in a number of studies , it &apos;s possible to compare how people do in more and less equal countries at each level in the social hierarch@@ y .
of course , there are people who dis@@ like this stuff and people who find it very surprising .
thank you .
it can pretty much do anything , but it &apos;s 20@@ ,000 dollars , and to give you a sense of who we@@ ars this , ve@@ ter@@ ans , american ve@@ ter@@ ans coming back from afghanistan or iraq would be fit with something like this .
and most medical devices , we &apos;ve learned , as we &apos;ve du@@ g in , are really designed for west@@ ern@@ ers , for weal@@ th@@ ier econom@@ ies .
and something that &apos;s not obvious is that we designed it for mass production .
we &apos;ve made incredible advan@@ ces in technology in recent years , but too often it seems only certain fortun@@ ate people can benefit . engineer kri@@ st@@ a don@@ al@@ d@@ son introdu@@ ces the re@@ motion k@@ nee , a pro@@ s@@ thetic device for abo@@ ve-@@ k@@ nee am@@ pu@@ te@@ es , many of whom ear@@ n less than $ 4 a day . the design con@@ tains be@@ st-@@ in-@@ class technology and yet is far che@@ aper than other pro@@ s@@ the@@ tics on the market .
you want an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned cell phone that you fli@@ p open and is about as big as your head ? three hundred bucks .
and that &apos;s my new life .
yeah ! yeah .
so that &apos;s my new life ; it &apos;s all about fun .
and turns out they liked it , and it made them happy -- not very happy , but a little bit of happy .
and when people are finished , they don &apos;t throw it away .
there &apos;s a little le@@ dge inside , so the te@@ a is sitting there and the water is fil@@ ling it up like that .
but that &apos;s refle@@ ctive design as well .
what happens to education ?
because it &apos;s being pil@@ ot@@ ed in a school where the students are already getting , let &apos;s say , 80 percent of whatever they could do .
about eight hours later , we found this kid .
i took the experiment out to nor@@ the@@ astern india , to a village called ma@@ dan@@ t@@ us@@ i , where , for some reason , there was no english teacher , so the children had not learned english at all .
so we had to solve all the problems we had without air condi@@ tion@@ ing and with very poor power , so most of the solutions that came out used little bla@@ sts of air put at the right places to keep the machines running .
so what does the ei@@ ght-@@ year-old do ?
values are ac@@ qui@@ red ; doc@@ tr@@ ine and do@@ g@@ ma are im@@ posed -- the two op@@ pos@@ ing mechanis@@ ms .
this is why i wear gra@@ y and black most of the time , and i have to take my wife with me to cho@@ se clo@@ th@@ es .
i negoti@@ ated with sa@@ d@@ dam &apos;s diplo@@ ma@@ ts at the u.@@ n .
i was ex@@ hau@@ sted , and i was also dis@@ illu@@ sion@@ ed in a way i couldn &apos;t quite put my finger on .
so took a running lea@@ p and jum@@ ped over the edge of a cli@@ ff .
and that ri@@ ot taught me something , which isn &apos;t immediately obvious and it &apos;s kind of a complicated story .
and ko@@ so@@ vo became independent .
the second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today .
something &apos;s got to be done about this .
the chan@@ ces of failure are very high , but it certainly won &apos;t happen if we don &apos;t try to make it happen .
what a 4@@ 0@@ 4 page tells you is that you fell through the cra@@ cks .
and what they learned was that those little things , done right , actually matter , and that well-@@ designed moments can build br@@ ands .
now today , we &apos;re not talking about good and bad tv .
what did this mean for you ?
take a look at this .
it can make me feel this ?
we had 9 / 11 .
but let me also thank the incredible cre@@ ators who get up everyday to put their ideas on our television scre@@ ens throughout all these ages of television .
don &apos;t get too atta@@ ched to him .
it takes control of these cells , turns them into vir@@ us-@@ making fac@@ tor@@ ies , and they all bur@@ st , a huge , exten@@ ded bacteria family , all dying with viruses sp@@ ill@@ ing out of their gu@@ ts , the viruses taking over the bacteri@@ um .
well , a very tiny fra@@ ction of them don &apos;t .
i &apos;m currently a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . student at mit , and i absolutely understand the importance of deta@@ iled , specific scientific communication between experts , but not when we &apos;re trying to teach 1@@ 3@@ -@@ year-@@ ol@@ ds .
i had no idea there were so many belie@@ vers at a ted conference .
but now i des@@ i@@ red the wel@@ f@@ are of all man@@ kind and could , with a feeling heart , for@@ give my worst ene@@ mi@@ es .
it feels somehow u@@ pli@@ f@@ ting .
so here &apos;s the milli@@ on-@@ dollar question for social scientists like me : is the sta@@ ir@@ case a fe@@ ature of our evolutionary design ?
so within the team , their interests are actually pit@@ ted against each other .
and nature &apos;s favorite solution is to put everyone in the same boat .
look at the people in these photos i &apos;ve been showing you .
no@@ wa@@ days we fly around like individual bees ex@@ ul@@ ting in our freedom .
and you can imagine , if you &apos;re a writer , that things would get really crow@@ ded around de@@ ad@@ lines .
so , pretty early on in my investig@@ ations i realized what i was finding was not what i expected to find , which was , quite frank@@ ly , a lot of be@@ er can pyrami@@ ds and over@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed cou@@ ches and fl@@ at@@ -@@ screen t@@ v@@ s .
and i realized that &apos;s because the guys that i met were all very passionate about what they did .
these are a couple of garage do@@ ors pain@@ ted iden@@ tical , situ@@ ated next to each other .
so , appar@@ ently when photograph@@ y was perfe@@ cted , there were people going around saying , that &apos;s it : you &apos;ve just ru@@ ined painting .
and it &apos;s -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before , and basically , i &apos;ve interpre@@ ted the different quot@@ es .
so , this is a si@@ x-@@ shot sequence .
they thought some people didn &apos;t like them .
and i was fortun@@ ate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books .
there &apos;s very few times you &apos;d be happy to find this on your car , but it did seem to indic@@ ate that we were coming back .
but i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sac@@ ra@@ men@@ to a few years back .
and i &apos;m not even sure we know what technology is .
and like you heard from the previous speak@@ ers , we don &apos;t really know what life there is on earth right now .
one of the things about evolution is that no@@ where on earth have we ever been where we don &apos;t find life .
this is a scene from star wars where the 3@@ p@@ o comes out and he sees machines making machines . how de@@ pra@@ ved !
so i took the great big 18@@ 95 mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery ward &apos;s cat@@ alo@@ g and i rand@@ om@@ ly went through it . and i took a page -- not quite a random page -- i took a page that was actually more difficult than others because lots of the pages are filled with things that are still being made . but i took this page and i said , how many of these things are still being made ?
that is what we call an &quot; infin@@ ite game . &quot;
i don &apos;t have an answer to the fact that there seem to be bad technologies . i don &apos;t have an answer to how this im@@ pac@@ ts on our dig@@ nity , other than to suggest that maybe the se@@ vent@@ h king@@ dom , because it &apos;s so close to what life is about , maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monit@@ or life .
i was in the gul@@ f , and i was swi@@ mming around and saw a little oc@@ top@@ us on the bottom .
then he li@@ f@@ ts another arm and i li@@ ft another arm .
so the first week was pretty much spent just getting as close as we could , every day a little closer , a little closer , a little closer .
and as you go deeper , that lo@@ vely , blue water you were launched in gives way to dar@@ ker and dar@@ ker blue .
and before the discovery of these v@@ ents , all life on earth , the key to life on earth , was believed to be the sun and photo@@ syn@@ thesis .
and ferti@@ li@@ z@@ ers and pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des are flo@@ wing into the bay from the golf course -- the pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des killing all the lar@@ va@@ e and little animals , ferti@@ li@@ zer creating this beautiful plan@@ k@@ ton blo@@ om -- and there &apos;s your pe@@ a sou@@ p .
and maybe these heal@@ ing z@@ ones can spr@@ in@@ kle a map , little dots on a map .
there were pl@@ ent@@ y of role models all around us .
because women are on the ground floor , and we know the tradi@@ tions so well , we can bring a different voice to the table .
but i feel bl@@ essed to be able to work with them .
and the question is : are going to look like in 20@@ 50 , or is it going to be this ?
that &apos;s called growth .
the bigger you are syste@@ matically , according to very well-@@ defined rules , less energy per capit@@ a .
but here &apos;s what &apos;s surprising .
something universal is going on .
it &apos;s the same p@@ lot .
she went to school to get the information because that &apos;s where the information lived .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know what she &apos;s in for . &quot;
the last question of the as@@ sign@@ ment is : how do you plan to use your life to posi@@ tively impact other people ?
and this is the work of the student that consi@@ st@@ ently did it .
di@@ ana lauf@@ en@@ berg shares 3 surprising things she has learned about teaching -- including a key insi@@ ght about learning from mista@@ kes . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
many of the talks yesterday talked about impro@@ ving the quality of life , and re@@ duc@@ ing poverty , and essentially increasing life expec@@ tan@@ cy all around the glo@@ be .
you can prevent .
and to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fe@@ tus .
what i &apos;m about to show you is a diab@@ e@@ tic ul@@ cer .
remember that i mentioned before the children who lose their finger@@ ti@@ ps .
just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data .
everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a so@@ d@@ ding approach .
china just launched a national tis@@ su@@ e-@@ engineering center .
i suppose it &apos;s fair to say that i am interested in the invention of self or selves .
that means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work .
you know , your parents must be very proud .
sorry , this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything , to be here right now .
at my school -- actually i was part of co-@@ fo@@ unding an organization , which is like a leadership thing , you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
it was like , you know , she was there in the class , you know , she was kind of typically french .
my name is pau@@ line ning , and first i want to tell you that i &apos;m -- of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york .
but she told me , &quot; mom , you don &apos;t have to worry about boys because i don &apos;t like them . &quot;
but , while i know that i may not look like the typical ted-@@ i@@ zen , as you would say , i do like to make the point that we in global society , we are never as different as the appe@@ ar@@ an@@ ces may suggest .
i &apos;ve actually been waiting by the phone and in fact , in 2000 , i was ready to talk about e@@ bay , but no call .
and for me , a lot of this started when i was yo@@ unger and my family used to go cam@@ ping in up@@ state new york .
and i wanted to figure out how i could take the bl@@ ess@@ ing of these resources and share it with the world .
and a light bul@@ b went off , which was , first , that i didn &apos;t actually have to do the writing myself , i could find wri@@ ters .
and with scre@@ en@@ ings on the h@@ ill , and discus@@ sions , and with our social sector part@@ ners , like the national organization of women , the film was wid@@ ely cre@@ di@@ ted with influ@@ en@@ cing the successful rene@@ w@@ al of the act .
we pre@@ mi@@ ered a film called &quot; the chicago 10 &quot; at s@@ und@@ ance this year .
perhaps not , i should certainly hope not -- because that is not my vision .
that &apos;s ster@@ ili@@ zing equipment in nigeria .
just so you know , i do believe in mis@@ sions , i do believe in aid and i do believe in char@@ ity . they have their place , but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier ?
people still believe in vo@@ o@@ do@@ o . heart disease , v@@ s@@ d , hole in the heart , te@@ tr@@ alo@@ gi@@ es .
that &apos;s exactly how the out@@ lets are designed .
se@@ y@@ i o@@ y@@ es@@ ol@@ a : a hospital tour in nigeria
i became a member of treatment action campaign and i &apos;m very proud to be a member of that incredible organization .
the message that un@@ aids are currently sending out to the world is that we would like to see the virtual elimin@@ ation of the trans@@ mission of the virus from mother to child by 20@@ 15 .
isn &apos;t it extraordinary ?
we have a situation where private companies are appl@@ ying cen@@ sor@@ ship standards that are often quite arb@@ it@@ r@@ ary and generally more nar@@ row than the free speech const@@ it@@ u@@ tional standards that we have in democra@@ cies .
as ri@@ ad@@ h gu@@ er@@ fal@@ i , the ve@@ ter@@ an digital activ@@ ist from tun@@ isi@@ a , re@@ mar@@ ked over this inci@@ dent , &quot; before , things were simple : you had the good guys on one side and the bad guys on the other .
so we have a situation in the world today where in more and more countries the relationship between citizens and governments is medi@@ ated through the internet , which is com@@ pris@@ ed pri@@ mar@@ ily of priv@@ ately ow@@ ned and oper@@ ated services .
at the moment , we still don &apos;t know .
and am@@ on@@ gst the chaos , am@@ i@@ d@@ st the eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wi@@ el@@ ded power before 198@@ 9 , in eastern europe , continu@@ ed to do so after the revol@@ u@@ tions there .
and the bal@@ kan@@ s was a fab@@ ul@@ ous place to start .
now , ci@@ gar@@ et@@ tes out the factory gate are very cheap .
on a positive note , we at last have someone in the white house who has consi@@ st@@ ently spo@@ ken out against these cor@@ ro@@ sive enti@@ ties .
not surprising , the most opport@@ uni@@ stic industry in the whole world .
these are mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os who carry the malari@@ al par@@ asi@@ te which infe@@ sts our blood when the mo@@ sy has had a free me@@ al at our expen@@ se .
so i &apos;m going to talk about it .
sho@@ ck , hor@@ ror .
it &apos;s what we ought to be doing .
so back in 198@@ 2 i said , &quot; well perhaps the eleph@@ ant had an a@@ qua@@ tic ance@@ st@@ or . &quot;
it &apos;s the only possible explanation of why humans , if they &apos;re very un@@ lucky , can become gross@@ ly ob@@ ese , in a way that would be totally impossible for any other pri@@ mate , physi@@ cally impossible .
everybody li@@ kes the a@@ qua@@ tic theory .
if you look back at the early years of the last century , there was a stand@@ -@@ off , a lot of bi@@ ck@@ ering and bad feeling between the belie@@ vers in men@@ del , and the belie@@ vers in darwin .
but you know , that makes me feel good , because richard da@@ w@@ kins has told us how to treat a pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od .
sin@@ cer@@ ely , mi@@ ster michael ban@@ go@@ or@@ a . &quot;
am i feeling lucky ?
and i know what you &apos;re saying . you &apos;re saying , &quot; hol@@ y cra@@ p , how is his pres@@ entation so smo@@ oth ? &quot;
but you come back as a du@@ ck .
in other words , it &apos;s a helping tool .
but what you &apos;re going to find eventually is you may need to actually get ele@@ cted offi@@ ci@@ als to help you out .
letters actually work .
you do a number of things : you &apos;re a vice president , you volunte@@ er , you do something else .
everybody &apos;s got one -- all of you .
and it is a tool that actually en@@ ables one to listen to their own inn@@ ards .
and so i actually live in canada now , so i &apos;ve been vis@@ iting one of my local gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers .
so if you &apos;ve been following the news , you &apos;ve heard that there &apos;s a pack of giant astero@@ ids head@@ ed for the united states , all sch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ed to stri@@ ke within the next 50 years .
why has it been ris@@ ing since the &apos; 7@@ 0s ?
now how did we do this ? how did we go from being h@@ unter@@ -@@ gather@@ ers 10,000 years ago to building these gigan@@ tic cities in just a few thousand years ?
it became much harder for them to soci@@ alize , much harder for them to co@@ operate .
now , there are many reasons why this is happening to us , and many of them we cannot rever@@ se .
and trying to run con@@ gress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil .
wh@@ ites are head@@ ed that way too .
please raise your hands .
jon@@ a@@ than ha@@ i@@ d@@ t : how common thre@@ ats can make common ground
it is able to move around its environment .
it might be able to self-@@ re@@ pair , and even respond to dra@@ matic changes in the immedi@@ ate environment .
an ac@@ cre@@ tion itself is a huge sin@@ k of carbon dio@@ xi@@ de .
i was ga@@ unt . i walked as though my legs were woo@@ den .
del@@ u@@ sions and hallu@@ cin@@ ations are hall@@ mar@@ ks of the illness .
and then , late on a fri@@ day night , on the roof of the y@@ ale law school , i began to sing , and not quie@@ tly either .
at times , i spent up to 20 hours in mechan@@ ical re@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , arms ti@@ ed , arms and legs ti@@ ed down , arms and legs ti@@ ed down with a net ti@@ ed ti@@ ghtly across my ch@@ est .
quot@@ ing from the text : &quot; i started the redu@@ ction of my me@@ ds , and within a short time i began feeling the effects .
the wall that kept me , el@@ yn , professor sa@@ ks , separate from that in@@ san@@ e woman hospit@@ alized years past , lay s@@ ma@@ shed and in ru@@ ins . &quot;
he dec@@ lin@@ ed , saying , &quot; don &apos;t take my de@@ vil@@ s away , because my angel@@ s may fle@@ e too . &quot;
we &apos;ve driven 14@@ 0,000 miles .
se@@ ba@@ stian th@@ run helped build google &apos;s amazing dri@@ ver@@ less car , powered by a very personal qu@@ est to save lives and reduce traffic acci@@ dents . ja@@ w@@ dro@@ pping video shows the dar@@ pa challen@@ ge-@@ w@@ inning car motor@@ ing through bus@@ y city traffic with no one behind the whe@@ el , and dra@@ matic test drive foot@@ age from ted@@ 20@@ 11 demon@@ str@@ ates how fast the thing can really go .
there were pre@@ ce@@ dent@@ -@@ setting su@@ its in 18@@ 70 and 18@@ 7@@ 2 , both invol@@ ving pri@@ ck@@ ly pe@@ ar cre@@ ek .
after all , there &apos;s a strong cor@@ relation between water and fishing , and for some , there &apos;s a strong cor@@ relation between fishing and be@@ er .
the bre@@ wers pay to re@@ store water to the stream .
what makes a strong female character is a character who has we@@ ak@@ n@@ esses , who has fla@@ ws , who is maybe not immediately lik@@ able , but eventually rel@@ at@@ able .
like , that &apos;s all you have to do .
therefore , to create the conditions for global compassion , all we have to do is to re@@ frame compassion as something that is fun .
and they raise enough money to build this hospital -- the first hospital of its kind for 200@@ ,000 people .
and because they &apos;re ambi@@ ti@@ ous for a greater good , they feel no need to inf@@ late their own e@@ gos .
and he consi@@ ders himself one of the in@@ mates .
imagine you can do that .
the second is in@@ sur@@ ing that there is syste@@ matic early access to coun@@ sel .
or a woman , i picked up her baby , really c@@ ute baby , i said &quot; your baby is so c@@ ute . &quot;
so the pieces are , not only the training of the law@@ yers , but us finding a way to syste@@ matically imple@@ ment early access to coun@@ sel , because they are the safe@@ gu@@ ard in the system for people who are being tor@@ tured .
i end always , because i &apos;m sure the questions are -- and i &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point -- &quot; but what can i really do ? &quot;
it took me a while to understand it , but when i discovered around 24 years of age that i was much more comfortable with objects than with people , i finally decided to really embra@@ ce this passion .
i was just recently in ar@@ gent@@ ina and in ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay , and the de@@ fau@@ lt way of building homes in the country is a beautiful moder@@ nis@@ m that you don &apos;t see el@@ se@@ where , but the con@@ temporary art was terrible .
it was about a new phase , in my opinion , in the world of design in that materials could be custom@@ i@@ zed by the designers themselves .
it was about design that de@@ als with safety and de@@ als with protection .
i want to make this point by showing you two examples of design coming from a sense of economy -- very , very clear limit@@ s .
simil@@ arly , there &apos;s the work of people like mar@@ ti gui@@ x@@ e that tries to invol@@ ve you in a way that is really about making everything pass through your mouth so that you learn from your mista@@ kes or from your taste , or@@ ally .
and it &apos;s the story of many of the afri@@ cans who are here .
let &apos;s go and try and talk to the head@@ mi@@ stress .
you know , so money ran out .
i was actually cr@@ ying during his pres@@ entation .
you know , it &apos;s not enough to com@@ pla@@ in . we need to act .
my partner , m , who &apos;s a tech gur@@ u , ha@@ cked wor@@ d@@ press .
i &apos;ve had lots of conver@@ sa@@ tions about things i think need to be happening in africa .
and he tried to talk me out of it , but it was like , &quot; ok , i know nothing about appl@@ ying to law school , i &apos;m poli@@ -@@ sc@@ i ph@@ .@@ d .
and as afri@@ cans , we need to take responsibility for our continent .
so we had to start from scrat@@ ch .
last no@@ v@@ ember 20@@ 12 , over 3@@ 3,000 run@@ ners from 85 different nation@@ ali@@ ties came to the start line , but this time , they challen@@ ged very stor@@ my and rain@@ y weather .
they &apos;re two big words , i don &apos;t know what they mean .
take a blood sam@@ ple and run it through a machine called a cou@@ l@@ ter coun@@ ter .
so this is a machine called the tou@@ ch@@ b qui@@ k .
the questions and conver@@ sa@@ tions that followed were fascinating .
rule number two : embra@@ ce the m@@ ess .
ra@@ m@@ sey mus@@ al@@ la@@ m : 3 rules to spar@@ k learning
you might find this strange , but in my family we have different acc@@ ents .
cities were totally wi@@ ped out because of the lack of water .
and there &apos;s predic@@ tions that we &apos;ll be nine billion by 20@@ 50 .
and so we will use that rene@@ w@@ able energy to produce the water that we need .
now , the an@@ ch@@ or wat@@ ches you with a strange ga@@ ze on his face , and then on the top of it you add , &quot; and thousands of the young people from ath@@ ens , ma@@ dri@@ d and new york will demon@@ strate for social justice , cla@@ im@@ ing that they are inspired with arab@@ s . &quot;
they will say , &quot; people power will work if the an@@ nu@@ al income of the country is between x and z . &quot;
there are certain rules in non@@ violent struggle you may follow .
well , that &apos;s just the beginning of the show .
will these revol@@ u@@ tions be whole like through the transi@@ tions to democracy or be over@@ taken by military or extre@@ mi@@ sts of all kinds ? we cannot tell .
at what point did i think that was a good idea ? &quot;
and then i looked at her and i said something that at the time felt a little dra@@ matic , but ended up being more prop@@ he@@ tic than dra@@ matic .
this is mostly , to be honest with you , from the business sector : innovation , creativity and change .
then we read your book and we ren@@ am@@ ed ourselves &apos; the break@@ down bab@@ es . &apos; &quot; and she said , &quot; our ta@@ gl@@ ine is : &apos; we &apos;re fall@@ ing apart and it feels fantastic . &apos; &quot; you can only imagine what it &apos;s like for me in a fac@@ ul@@ ty meeting .
my@@ sh@@ k@@ in ing@@ aw@@ ale , i hope i did right by you .
and that &apos;s what this conference , to me , is about .
sh@@ ame is highly , highly cor@@ related with addi@@ ction , depression , violence , ag@@ gr@@ ession , bu@@ ll@@ ying , su@@ i@@ cide , eating dis@@ orders .
and i said , &quot; i don &apos;t study men . &quot;
if we &apos;re going to find our way back to each other , vulner@@ ability is going to be that path .
so maybe we &apos;ll try it once -- to fly a smar@@ t@@ bird .
pl@@ ent@@ y of robots can fly -- but none can fly like a real bird . that is , until mark@@ us fis@@ cher and his team at fest@@ o built smar@@ t@@ bird , a large , ligh@@ t@@ weight robot , mod@@ el@@ ed on a se@@ ag@@ ul@@ l , that flies by fla@@ pping its wings . a so@@ aring dem@@ o fresh from ted@@ global 20@@ 11 .
and i think this was possible thanks to the building blocks put in place by dr . v . , a value system , an efficient deli@@ very process , and fo@@ ster@@ ing the culture of innovation .
but they get glas@@ ses in the fra@@ mes of their choice , and that &apos;s very important because i think glas@@ ses , in addition to helping people see , is also a fashion stat@@ ement , and they &apos;re willing to pay for it .
they do one thing at a time . they do it extremely well .
and we do about 3@@ 00,000 .
and for us humans , it &apos;s not quite material , it &apos;s not really there -- it &apos;s virtual .
for example , it can be thin in your po@@ cket , which we of course want it to be ; but then if you hold it in your hand , it can le@@ an towards you , be th@@ ick .
and i think making it physical is a good way to do that .
it seemed to open up new perspe@@ c@@ tives , and ther@@ ein lay the paradig@@ m shift .
and what they &apos;re finding is that even tra@@ ce amounts of oil and dis@@ pers@@ ants can be highly tox@@ ic to phy@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , which is very bad news , because so much life depends on it .
better to er@@ r on the side of cau@@ tion .
so we have gre@@ ed , we &apos;ve got over@@ confidence / hu@@ br@@ is , but since we &apos;re here at ted@@ women , let &apos;s consider one other factor that could be contribu@@ ting in some small way to socie@@ tal re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness .
in a way , that is the story of the sett@@ ling of the americ@@ as , the sup@@ pos@@ ed@@ ly in@@ ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ble fron@@ tier to which europe@@ ans es@@ cap@@ ed .
it &apos;s worth taking a moment to understand this practice , because i believe it spea@@ ks to re@@ ck@@ less@@ ness and the path we &apos;re on like little else .
at the very last minute , we are going to get saved just like in every hollywood movie , just like in the ra@@ p@@ ture .
days before this talk , journalist na@@ om@@ i klein was on a boat in the gul@@ f of mexico , looking at the cat@@ astrop@@ hi@@ c results of b@@ p &apos;s ris@@ ky pur@@ suit of oil . our societies have become addi@@ cted to extreme risk in finding new energy , new financial instruments and more ... and too often , we &apos;re left to clean up a m@@ ess after@@ ward . klein &apos;s question : what &apos;s the back@@ up plan ?
perfect .
dh : now richard , please ...
bf : i think we were just outside .
dh : grab the bla@@ des in mi@@ d-@@ air , land right there in a pool of blood ...
dh : how you feeling , bar@@ ry ? you feeling all right ?
bf : there we go !
what do you want me to do with it ?
do you want to buy a vo@@ we@@ l , bar@@ ry ?
the first computer was really designed in the 18@@ 3@@ 0s and 18@@ 4@@ 0s , not the 193@@ 0s and 194@@ 0s .
you see it all like this .
this is actually a picture of the prin@@ ting mechan@@ ism for another machine of his , called the difference engine no@@ . 2 , which he never built , but which the science museum did build in the &apos; 8@@ 0s and &apos; 9@@ 0s .
now , a hundred years later , this guy comes along , al@@ an turing , and in 193@@ 6 , and inv@@ ents the computer all over again .
when it &apos;s built , you &apos;ll finally be able to understand how a computer works , because rather than having a tiny chip in front of you , you &apos;ve got to look at this hum@@ on@@ g@@ ous thing and say , &quot; ah , i see the memory operating , i see the c@@ p@@ u operating , i hear it operating . i probably smell it operating . &quot;
we don &apos;t want to believe what we know .
here in america , 90 percent of the cor@@ n cul@@ tiv@@ ated is used to feed animals or to do oil .
se@@ vent@@ h we invented stories , we fle@@ w around the world , while rema@@ ining in our at@@ tic .
14@@ th let &apos;s say that you and me like each other .
and what bin@@ ds us together is far greater than what divi@@ des us .
there is no business on this movie .
in 2003 , the final version was published , and they keep working on it .
she goes home .
guys , this would never have happened without whole genome sequen@@ cing .
and in fact , the ty@@ pe@@ writer was essentially del@@ et@@ ed by this thing .
do you think that &apos;s not going to happen ?
so i am a pe@@ di@@ atri@@ c cancer doctor and ste@@ m-@@ cell resear@@ cher at stanford university where my clinical focus has been bone mar@@ row transplan@@ tation .
we can do multiple pas@@ ses through that same ent@@ ry .
dan@@ iel kraft : a better way to harv@@ est bone mar@@ row
but in the other bran@@ ch of reality , he rema@@ ins alive .
but before talking about what we might see , let me describe the particles we already know of .
electr@@ ons have an electric charge , a negative one , and quar@@ ks have electric char@@ ges in thir@@ ds .
and we can ro@@ tate this charge space in four dimensions to get a better look at the strong interaction , which has this nice h@@ ex@@ ag@@ onal symme@@ try .
a physi@@ c@@ ist looks for larger , more symme@@ tri@@ c patterns that inclu@@ de the establi@@ shed pattern as a sub@@ set .
it &apos;s a fantastic pro@@ spe@@ ct that this object of great mathematical beauty could describe the truth of partic@@ le inter@@ actions at the small@@ est sc@@ ales imag@@ in@@ able .
i &apos;ve tried the best i can to live a bal@@ an@@ ced life .
and that would be what explains all these element@@ ary particles that we see .
and we &apos;ve also been hearing about the history , the family tree , of man@@ kind through dna genetic pro@@ fil@@ ing .
they also k@@ is@@ s , hold hands , p@@ at one another on the back .
ways of rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing over@@ used far@@ m@@ land , so that within two years they can again be productive .
today , they are saying four . but we don &apos;t have them . we &apos;ve got one .
and this kind of thing is not just in africa . it &apos;s all over the world .
and wo@@ ven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmon@@ y within ourselves , in our families , in our communities , between nations , between cultures , between religi@@ ons and between us and the natural world .
and then talking about rene@@ w@@ able energy -- des@@ per@@ ately important .
ken s@@ aro@@ -@@ wi@@ wa , in nigeria , who took on the giant oil companies , and although people around the world tried their best , was ex@@ ecu@@ ted .
i then , in the last few years , learned about the pacific g@@ arb@@ age pat@@ ch and the gy@@ re .
it is down@@ -@@ cy@@ cl@@ ed and turned into less@@ er things , while a glass bot@@ tle can be a glass bot@@ tle again or can be used again -- a plastic bot@@ tle can never be a plastic bot@@ tle again .
i &apos;m wearing a camera , just a simple web@@ c@@ am , a port@@ able , batter@@ y-@@ powered proje@@ ction system with a little mirror .
this is ju@@ an &apos;s book , our previous speak@@ er , which gets a great r@@ ating , by the way , at ama@@ zon .
we didn &apos;t know if he had per@@ ished yet until 3@@ 6 hours later .
i was married when i was 14 .
then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
the first thing is water .
people were sho@@ ot@@ ing each other on the streets for tv sets and water .
we &apos;re just going to po@@ ur that in there .
deli@@ cious .
she pi@@ cks the water up from there , des@@ al@@ in@@ ates it , for free , transpor@@ ts it over there , and du@@ mp@@ s it onto the mountains , ri@@ vers , and stre@@ ams .
but what h@@ ous@@ man understood , and you hear it in the sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies of ni@@ el@@ sen too , was that the long , hot , sil@@ van su@@ mm@@ ers of st@@ ability of the 19@@ th century were coming to a close , and that we were about to move into one of those terri@@ fying peri@@ ods of history when power changes .
it &apos;s always su@@ it@@ able for those who have the most power to operate in spaces without con@@ stra@@ int , but the lesson of history is that , so@@ on@@ er or later , un@@ reg@@ ul@@ ated space -- space not subject to the rule of law -- becomes popul@@ ated , not just by the things you wanted -- international trade , the internet , etc . -- but also by the things you don &apos;t want -- international crimin@@ ality , international terror@@ ism .
my second point is , and i know i don &apos;t have to talk to an audience like this about such a thing , but power is not just shif@@ ting ver@@ tically , it &apos;s also shif@@ ting horizon@@ t@@ ally .
a fix@@ ed po@@ lar@@ ity of power means fix@@ ed alli@@ an@@ ces .
what is the largest na@@ val cont@@ ing@@ ent tac@@ kl@@ ing the issue of som@@ al@@ i pir@@ ates ?
now if i want to talk about the defen@@ se of my country , i have to speak to the minister of health because pan@@ de@@ mic disease is a threat to my security , i have to speak to the minister of agriculture because food security is a threat to my security , i have to speak to the minister of industry because the fra@@ gi@@ li@@ ty of our hi@@ -@@ tech infrastructure is now a point of attack for our ene@@ mi@@ es -- as we see from cy@@ ber war@@ f@@ are -- i have to speak to the minister of home aff@@ air@@ s because who has enter@@ ed my country , who lives in that ter@@ ra@@ ced house in that inner city has a direct effect on what happens in my country -- as we in london saw in the 7 / 7 bom@@ b@@ ings .
i started with a po@@ em , i &apos;ll end with one .
spiritu@@ ality ? and how about how we soci@@ alize ?
our ar@@ ter@@ ies can clo@@ g . our brains can g@@ un@@ k up with pla@@ que , and we can get alzheimer &apos;s .
because the land is so in@@ ferti@@ le , they lar@@ gely are she@@ pher@@ ds , which occasi@@ ons regular , low-@@ inten@@ sity physical activity .
and the fact that this culture has y@@ i@@ el@@ ded these numbers suggests stron@@ g@@ ly they have something to teach us .
there is our work life , where we &apos;re productive .
they celebra@@ te their s@@ ab@@ bat@@ h from sun@@ set on fri@@ day ti@@ ll sun@@ set on satur@@ day .
he &apos;s a multi@@ milli@@ on@@ ai@@ re , yet when a contra@@ ctor wanted 6@@ ,000 dollars to build a priv@@ acy f@@ ence , he said , &quot; for that kind of money i &apos;ll do it myself . &quot;
these 100@@ -year-old o@@ kin@@ aw@@ an women are getting up and down off the ground , they sit on the floor , 30 or 40 times a day .
they put their families first , take care of their children and their aging parents .
conduc@@ tive ink has been used by artists , but recent develop@@ ments indic@@ ate that we will soon be able to use it in las@@ er pr@@ inter@@ s and p@@ ens .
so many times , ama@@ te@@ urs , not experts , have been the inv@@ ent@@ ors and impro@@ vers of things ran@@ ging from mountain bi@@ kes to se@@ mi@@ conduc@@ tors , personal computers , air@@ planes .
back then , computers were these large ma@@ infra@@ mes only scientists car@@ ed about , and no one dre@@ am@@ ed of even having one at home .
you &apos;re in this exten@@ ded body .
it &apos;s really not that hard to make reas@@ on@@ able predic@@ tions about where a car &apos;s going to be in the near future .
so you don &apos;t only know that he &apos;s going off course , you know how .
and i want to tell you that story .
i think the human race doesn &apos;t have a future if it doesn &apos;t go into space .
x prize fo@@ under peter diam@@ and@@ is talks about how he helped ste@@ phen ha@@ w@@ king ful@@ fill his dream of going to space -- by flying together into the upp@@ er atmosphere and experi@@ en@@ cing wei@@ ght@@ less@@ ness at zero g .
they power our minds .
but it &apos;s really quite amazing that these cells , these micro@@ -@@ machines , are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bi@@ d@@ ding .
the do@@ g@@ g@@ y went into do@@ g@@ g@@ y day care .
i just wasn &apos;t dr@@ un@@ k or high .
and i was no longer invisible .
there was just no future .
it &apos;s been bl@@ essed . &quot;
and we didn &apos;t need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villa@@ gers themselves .
but unfortunately , the government was in den@@ ial , den@@ ial , den@@ ial .
and no parents obje@@ cted , because we were trying to save lives , and this was a li@@ fes@@ a@@ ver .
and then this is the picture i mentioned to you -- the wea@@ pon of mass protection .
they plant the trees , and the money goes into their micro@@ credit fund , which we call the village development bank .
and here is a b@@ am@@ bo@@ o building -- all of them are b@@ am@@ bo@@ o .
when ro@@ mo wa@@ kes up , he &apos;s in cre@@ ature mode .
you do not have to teach someone how to drive ro@@ mo .
so we think that if you &apos;re going to have a robot in your home , that robot ought to be a mani@@ fest@@ ation of your own imagination .
i was told that this was no laugh@@ ing matter .
also , two women with passionate he@@ arts : wan@@ gar@@ i ma@@ ath@@ ai , the no@@ bel pri@@ ze@@ w@@ inner from kenya who has plan@@ ted 30 million trees . and by doing so , she has changed the soil , the weather , in some places in africa , and of course the economic conditions in many villa@@ ges .
a place where most men would love to be .
i was born in ancient times , at the end of the world , in a patri@@ arch@@ al ca@@ tho@@ lic and conser@@ va@@ tive family .
she &apos;s not licen@@ sed for that ; she has never done it .
in a matter of five or six years , they have a forest , the soil is en@@ rich@@ ed , and the village is saved .
even the most dest@@ it@@ ute of men have someone they can ab@@ use -- a woman or a child .
you don &apos;t want to sell too early , because you miss out on prof@@ its , but you don &apos;t want to wait too late to when everyone else s@@ ells , tri@@ g@@ ger@@ ing a crash .
they don &apos;t necessarily pick exactly 3@@ 3 and 22 .
the twi@@ st is that one player , on the left , is in@@ formed about how much on each trial there is .
and by the way , these were trials where their de@@ als were made .
this is a young ch@@ im@@ p . the young ones are better than the old ones , just like humans .
now we move the pa@@ yo@@ ff@@ s .
and given that it takes three times as much gra@@ in -- actually ten times as much gra@@ in -- to feed a human if it &apos;s passed through an animal first , that &apos;s not a very efficient way of fe@@ eding us .
and it was also ferti@@ le .
and if you look at the name of one of those streets , bread street , you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago .
they &apos;re being s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ ed out of sight and mind , somewhere in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
and also they &apos;ve made us depen@@ dent on systems that only they can deliver , that , as we &apos;ve seen , are un@@ sustainable .
but you can &apos;t have scen@@ es like this unless you have people like this .
it &apos;s a re-@@ concep@@ tu@@ alization of the way food shapes our lives .
something that goes beyond what we know in our e@@ go@@ -@@ bo@@ und existence .
in mal@@ ay@@ si@@ a , there is going to be an art exhi@@ bi@@ tion in which leading artists are going to be taking people , young people , and showing them that compassion also lies at the ro@@ ot of all art .
and of course the problems sometimes seem in@@ super@@ able .
and if we can trans@@ late that into our built environment , then there &apos;s some exciting potential for the way that we build things .
the other one is from the previous bri@@ ck that was placed .
so you can basically program any three-@@ dimensional shape -- or one-@@ dimensional , two-@@ dimensional -- up into this chain completely passi@@ vely .
i think there &apos;s a sense that many of us have that the great age of explor@@ ation on earth is over , that for the next generation they &apos;re going to have to go to ou@@ ter space or the deep@@ est oceans in order to find something significant to explore .
as we started to look at this information , we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose doesn &apos;t match anything that we &apos;ve ever seen before -- no plant , animal , fun@@ gu@@ s , virus or bacteria .
we &apos;ve been to the moon , we &apos;ve ma@@ pped the contin@@ ents , we &apos;ve even been to the deep@@ est point in the ocean -- twice . what &apos;s left for the next generation to explore ? biolog@@ ist and explor@@ er na@@ than wol@@ fe suggests this answer : almost everything . and we can start , he says , with the world of the un@@ see@@ ably small .
well , at enormous expen@@ se , ted has arr@@ ange@@ d a high-@@ resol@@ ution immer@@ sion virtual reality ren@@ der@@ ing of inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space -- the view from inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic space .
not just a super@@ ficial image of it , though it con@@ tains that as well , but an explan@@ atory model , em@@ bo@@ dying the same mathematical relationships and the same cau@@ sal structure .
well , again , it &apos;s dark out there to human senses . but all you &apos;ve got to do is take a telescop@@ e , even one of pres@@ ent@@ -@@ day design , look out and you &apos;ll see the same galaxies as we do from here .
now , i &apos;m a physi@@ c@@ ist , but i &apos;m not the right kind of physi@@ c@@ ist . in reg@@ ard to global warming , i &apos;m just a la@@ y@@ man . and the rational thing for a la@@ y@@ man to do is to take seriously the pre@@ vail@@ ing scientific theory . and according to that theory , it &apos;s already too late to avoid a disaster .
these african students are doing their home@@ work under stre@@ et@@ lights at the air@@ port in the capital city because they don &apos;t have any electricity at home .
they want the choice to be able to continue consum@@ ing sub@@ si@@ di@@ zed electric power .
this next ch@@ art looks at more recent data .
but cities give you this opportunity to create new places , with new rules that people can op@@ t in to .
the thing that was bad about col@@ oni@@ alism , and the thing which is resi@@ du@@ ally bad in some of our aid programs , is that it involved elements of co@@ er@@ ci@@ on and con@@ des@@ cen@@ sion .
now , if we gener@@ alize this and think about not just one or two char@@ ter c@@ ites , but do@@ zens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions , perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them ?
so the in@@ centi@@ ves for the people helping to constru@@ ct this zone and build it , and set up the basic rules , go very much in the right direction .
genom@@ ics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was , by the end of this year , we might have between three and five genom@@ es sequen@@ ced ; it &apos;s on the order of several hundred .
the other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these phot@@ ore@@ cep@@ tors dete@@ ct different wa@@ vel@@ eng@@ ths of light , and we can predict that based on their am@@ in@@ o ac@@ id sequence .
but it turns out the environment is very critical for this , and you can only define an essential or non-@@ essential gene based on exactly what &apos;s in the environment .
the key is , how do you put all of the others ?
we &apos;re also combin@@ ing cell@@ ul@@ ases , the enzy@@ mes that break down complex sug@@ ars into simple sug@@ ars and fer@@ ment@@ ation in the same cell for producing eth@@ an@@ ol .
promis@@ ed virtu@@ es fall pre@@ y to the passi@@ ons of the moment .
it &apos;s always about &quot; what is this situation like that i &apos;ve experienced in the past ? &quot;
they sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce family time . they sac@@ ri@@ fi@@ ce friend time .
or this ?
makes it a lot easier to put a col@@ ony up there .
its atmosphere is lar@@ gely molecular ni@@ tro@@ gen , like you are brea@@ thing here in this room , except that its atmosphere is suff@@ used with simple organic materials like me@@ than@@ e and pro@@ pan@@ e and eth@@ an@@ e .
it was so my@@ sti@@ fying : we couldn &apos;t make out what we were seeing on ti@@ tan .
but this is some@@ what of a shor@@ eline .
and i think you would agree that we have found ti@@ tan is a remarkable , my@@ st@@ ical place . it &apos;s ex@@ o@@ tic , it &apos;s alien , but yet str@@ angel@@ y ear@@ th-@@ like , and having ear@@ th-@@ like ge@@ ological forma@@ tions and a tremendous geogra@@ phi@@ cal diversity , and is a fascinating world whose only ri@@ val in the solar system for complexity and rich@@ ness is the earth itself .
but as if that weren &apos;t brilliant enough , we can spot , in this beautiful image , sight of our own planet , cra@@ d@@ led in the arms of saturn &apos;s r@@ ings .
isra@@ el@@ i the f@@ ence has , in fact , created a solution to ter@@ ror .
what was even more surprising was the fact that bu@@ dru@@ s was successful .
the leaders of this movement have been using bu@@ dru@@ s as one of their primary rec@@ ru@@ iting tools .
maps matter .
and the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pul@@ ses or spi@@ kes of electricity via connections to each other .
and the cell on the right there fir@@ es whenever there &apos;s a boundar@@ y to the south , whether it &apos;s the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart .
so back to hom@@ er .
they &apos;re just like everyone else .
that &apos;s a result . it &apos;s always a result .
want to buy one ? &quot;
it &apos;s all gro@@ unded in the ten@@ ets of biology .
most people don &apos;t know about sam@@ u@@ el pi@@ er@@ po@@ nt lang@@ ley .
and , eventually , on dec@@ ember 17@@ th , 19@@ 0@@ 3 , the w@@ right brothers took flight , and no one was there to even experience it .
they &apos;re more comfortable making those intui@@ tive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available .
because you see , when tiv@@ o launched their product they told us all what they had .
they showed up for themselves .
we had mom@@ s who would come in , daughter has as@@ th@@ ma , wa@@ kes up covered in cock@@ ro@@ ach@@ es every morning .
so health leads was born of these conver@@ sa@@ tions -- a simple model where doctors and nur@@ ses can pres@@ cri@@ be nutri@@ ti@@ ous food , heat in the winter and other basic resources for their patients the same way they pres@@ cri@@ be medic@@ ation .
this as@@ pi@@ ration that our health@@ care keep us healthy is an enor@@ m@@ ously powerful one .
you need more .
now l@@ est you think it im@@ prob@@ able that a college volunte@@ er can make this kind of commit@@ ment , i have two words for you : mar@@ ch ma@@ dness .
so i had been at legal services for about nine months when this idea of health leads started per@@ col@@ ating in my mind .
if you roll it forward -- 20@@ th-@@ century security -- into the second world war , you see the battle of stal@@ ing@@ rad , 300 days , 2 million people killed .
at the moment , they &apos;re in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
so here we are , 21@@ st century .
this is a us na@@ vy war@@ ship .
now , you &apos;re looking at this thinking , &quot; ah , ad@@ mi@@ ral , these must be sea lan@@ es of communication , or these might be fi@@ ber op@@ tic c@@ ables . &quot;
that is the core of who we are and what we do , and we do it to protect freedom , freedom of speech , all the things we tre@@ as@@ ure in our societies .
remember that sort of , um . this is the jo@@ ke i did when the florida bal@@ lot was going around . you know , count the dots for gore ; count the dots for bush ; count &apos; em again ...
they &apos;re looking out two direc@@ tions at once . you have a larger piece fit@@ ting in with a smaller . and that &apos;s something for you to think about , all right ? so you see larger pieces fit@@ ting in within smaller pieces here . does everyone see that ? which is impossible . you can see the two kids are looking out simul@@ tane@@ ously out of two different direc@@ tions at once . now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape ? they are .
large families still , and the hiv epidemic brought down the countries like this .
and this is the united states moving away here , ear@@ ning more money .
and behind the health is the edu@@ cational level .
she took care of me as a child , so i &apos;m not talking about stati@@ stic now -- now it &apos;s oral history in my family .
and there we are , 2001 .
and this is the so@@ f@@ a , how it will emer@@ ge from there .
and this woman is very happy now , bringing her products to the market .
ho@@ ma@@ ge to the office pac@@ ka@@ ge , no ?
govern@@ ance , well it &apos;s fun to vote in a little thing , but it &apos;s not a goal .
can i requ@@ est a moment of absolute sil@@ ence ?
here &apos;s my par@@ o@@ dy and it a@@ in &apos;t much of one .
this is not about proje@@ cting power , but about sta@@ ying power , which is about legi@@ ti@@ ma@@ cy with the loc@@ als .
there is no secre@@ t@@ ary of everything else .
but here &apos;s the deal .
what we need is an international re@@ construction fund -- se@@ ba@@ stian m@@ all@@ ab@@ y , washington post , great idea .
china , all grown up , going to be a loo@@ ker !
it &apos;s not our system of govern@@ ance .
because we &apos;d all be gay then .
what we need to do is inter@@ -@@ agen@@ cy oper@@ ations , which frank@@ ly con@@ di ri@@ ce was in charge of .
this is the history of the mar@@ ines -- small wars , small arms .
reser@@ ve compon@@ ent -- national gu@@ ard reser@@ ves over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ingly sy@@ s ad@@ m@@ in .
we have talked about it end@@ less@@ ly over the last decade or so .
and it &apos;s this stuff in the middle here , which is what you do if you don &apos;t stop the emissions quickly enough .
it &apos;s really important to say . so much of the other things that we ought to do , like slo@@ wing emissions , are in@@ trin@@ si@@ cally slow , because it takes time to build all the hard@@ ware we need to reduce emissions .
it just sun@@ k below the surface . we weren &apos;t allowed to speak about it .
but it looks like we could achieve long atmosp@@ her@@ ic life@@ times -- much longer than before -- because they &apos;re le@@ vi@@ t@@ ated .
they develop science that makes it easier and easier to do .
there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about exactly how much climate change is too much .
i think there is a serious problem : as you talk about this , people begin to think they don &apos;t need to work so hard to cut emissions .
already we &apos;ve found the world &apos;s highest mountains , the world &apos;s deep@@ est val@@ le@@ ys , under@@ water la@@ kes , under@@ water water@@ falls -- a lot of that we shared with you from the stage .
here &apos;s an oc@@ top@@ us . sometimes they don &apos;t want to be seen when they move because pre@@ dat@@ ors can see them .
so these are a few images i was lucky to take and be there .
some people say happiness is right now ; it &apos;s the quality of the fres@@ hn@@ ess of the present moment .
can we have this kind of well-@@ being while being sad ? in a way , why not ?
so one ev@@ ening , he said , &quot; look , you are doing all these things , but isn &apos;t it nice , also , to build something within ? &quot;
li@@ ke@@ wise , behind every single thought there is the bare consciousness , pure awareness .
and , at the end , although it may rise , it will just cross the mind , like a bird cros@@ sing the sky without leaving any track .
of course , during the training , we do that with objects .
we are ready to spend 15 years achie@@ ving education .
and it &apos;s a tremendous problem for us .
we need better places in this country .
because this was percei@@ ved to be a weather problem .
of course , they &apos;ll never be there , as long as this is in that condition .
basically , a house with nothing on the side because this house wants to state , emp@@ ha@@ tically , &quot; i &apos;m a little cab@@ in in the wo@@ ods . there &apos;s nothing on either side of me .
forget it . it &apos;s not going to happen .
we are sle@@ ep@@ walking into the future .
while our sele@@ ction process is not as ri@@ gor@@ ous as nasa , it &apos;s non@@ eth@@ eless th@@ or@@ ough .
i don &apos;t think there &apos;s been a mission like that in a long time .
this is one of the places where planet@@ ary scientists believe there is a highest prob@@ ability of the dete@@ ction of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there .
if we see something that looks interesting , we pull it into a micro@@ scope .
or@@ b@@ ital hot@@ els to start with , but work@@ sh@@ ops for the rest of us later on .
we can go and use in@@ fl@@ at@@ able systems for almost everything .
we &apos;re at a ma@@ gical con@@ flu@@ ence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space .
and , anyway , the next morning we had to go along to the je@@ wel@@ er and get it cut off .
rb : yeah , as it turned out , it pro@@ ved to be the right move .
how much -- what &apos;s the total re@@ venue ?
well , god saved her and you got your just reward .
so , now , you &apos;ve always had this explor@@ ation bu@@ g in you .
but it was a wonderful feeling being in that water and -- what did you write to your family ?
here &apos;s a net in the sea , and the fish have been pulled from the sea into this net .
so the police kno@@ cked on the door , and told us they were going to ar@@ rest us if we car@@ ried on men@@ tion@@ ing the word v@@ ener@@ e@@ al disease .
i mean , do you think about life balance ?
it &apos;s important that if people do go to africa and do try to help , they don &apos;t just go in there and then leave after a few years .
so i would like to thank you for that inspiration , and for coming to ted today . thank you .
